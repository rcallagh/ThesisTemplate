\begin{chapterabstract}
  This chapter presents a series of experiments performed using ConFiG phantoms to test their microstructural realism, something essential to prove the value of ConFiG phantoms.

  Firstly, the methodology used to calculate microstructural features from ConFiG phantom meshes are presented. The dependency of some of these features on the input morphology is demonstrated, followed by a series of experiments which compare ConFiG phantoms to real white matter reconstructed from electron microscopy.
