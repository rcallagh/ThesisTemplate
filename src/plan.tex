\chapter{Rough Plan	}
\label{sec:plan}

\section{General idea}
Summary of work done so far in PhD. That is, GPU diffusion simulations and fibre growth algorithm. 
The work will either be highlighted in the context of diffusion MRI or diffusion MRS but I'm not certain which may be the best choice yet. 

\section{Rough Structure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item General introduction to the context of the project. Why do this work, set the scene for the coming sections
	\end{itemize}
	\item Background
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basic physics of MRI/MRS and diffusion
		\item Description of how diffusion simulation works 
		\item Description of GPU architecture, why it has potential
		\item Perhaps description of what we know about growth of fibres
	\end{itemize}
	\item Literature Review
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simulation review that I've already done
		\item GPU simulations, there's a couple out there (the one from 2011, and this year)
		\item Some review of growth things, probably discuss previous white matter substrates, maybe mention space colonisation for contextual growth.
	\end{itemize}
      \item Methodology  
	\begin{itemize}
          \item Describe the goals of the project
		\item Describing how the GPU code is structured
		\item How the diffusion simulations happen on the GPU
		\item Describing the growth algorithm 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Results
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Some GPU vs CPU speed, signal accuracy tests
		\item Essentially what we submitted to IPMI/ISMRM for the fibre stuff 
	\end{itemize}
      \item Discussion
      \item Future plans
\end{itemize}
