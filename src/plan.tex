\chapter{Rough Plan	}
\label{sec:plan}

\section{General idea}
Summary of all of the ConFiG work done in the PhD, split into four sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item The original ipmi implementation
\item Teh additions to make final ConFiG
\item the microstructural evalulation from the config paper
\item The FRF experiments
\end{itemize}


\section{Rough Structure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item General introduction to the context of the project. Why do this work, set the scene for the coming sections
	\end{itemize}
	\item Background
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basic physics of MRI/MRS and diffusion
		\item Description of how diffusion simulation works
		\item Perhaps description of what we know about growth of fibres
	\end{itemize}
	\item Literature Review
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simulation review that I've already done
		\item Some review of growth things, probably discuss previous white matter substrates, maybe mention space colonisation for contextual growth.
	\end{itemize}
      \item IPMI implementation
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Essentially this is just the IPMI paper with the very basic evaluation of the dMRI signals
		\end{itemize}
	  \item ConFiG
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Extra biological motivations
		\item more thorough dMRI evaluation
		\end{itemize}
	  \item Microstructural evaluation
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Microstructural eval from ConFiG paper
		\item including the new evaluation of the cross sections
		\end{itemize}
	  \item FRF experiment
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Still just working this one through
		\end{itemize}
      \item Discussion
      \item Future plans
\end{itemize}
