abstract = {Purpose: To demonstrate an optimized rectification strategy for fiber orientation density functions (fODFs). Theory and Methods: In white matter, fODFs can be estimated with diffusion MRI. However, because of signal noise, imaging artifacts and other factors, experimentally determined fODFs may take on unphysical negative values in some directions. Here, we show how to rectify such fODFs to eliminate all negative values while minimizing the mean square difference between the original and rectified fODFs. The method is demonstrated for a mathematical model and for fODFs estimated from experimental human data using both constrained spherical deconvolution and fiber ball imaging. Comparison with an alternative nonoptimized rectification approach is also provided. Results: For the mathematical model, it is found that the optimized rectification procedure removes negative fODF values while at the same time reducing the mean square error. Relative to the alternative rectification approach, the optimized fODFs are substantially more accurate. For the experimental data, the optimized fODFs have a lower average fractional anisotropy axonal and often fewer small peaks than the original, unrectified fODFs. The calculation of optimized fODFs is straightforward where the main step is the finding of the root to an equation in one variable, as may be efficiently accomplished with the bisection method. Conclusion: Unphysical negative fODF values can be easily eliminated in a manner that minimizes the mean square difference between the original and rectified fODFs. Optimized fODF rectification may be useful in applications for which negative values are problematic.},

abstract = {Since the realization that diffusion MRI can probe the microstructural organization and orientation of biological tissue in vivo and non-invasively, a multitude of diffusion imaging methods have been developed and applied to study the living human brain. Diffusion tensor imaging was the first model to be widely adopted in clinical and neuroscience research, but it was also clear from the beginning that it suffered from limitations when mapping complex configurations, such as crossing fibres. In this review, we highlight the main steps that have led the field of diffusion imaging to move from the tensor model to the adoption of diffusion and fibre orientation density functions as a more effective way to describe the complexity of white matter organization within each brain voxel. Among several techniques, spherical deconvolution has emerged today as one of the main approaches to model multiple fibre orientations and for tractography applications. Here we illustrate the main concepts and the reasoning behind this technique, as well as the latest developments in the field. The final part of this review provides practical guidelines and recommendations on how to set up processing and acquisition protocols suitable for spherical deconvolution.},

This characterization relies on relations between macroscopic diffusion metrics and structure at the mesoscopic scale commensurate with the diffusion length. Establishing such relations remains a fundamental challenge, hindering progress in materials science, porous media, and biomedical imaging. Here we show that the dynamical exponent in the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient distinguishes between the universality classes of the mesoscopic structural complexity. Our approach enables the interpretation of diffusion measurements by objectively selecting and modeling the most relevant structural features. As an example, the specific values of the dynamical exponent allow us to identify the relevant mesoscopic structure affecting MRI-measured water diffusion in muscles and in brain, and to elucidate the structural changes behind the decrease of diffusion coefficient in ischemic stroke.},

abstract = {Interpreting brain diffusion MRI measurements in terms of neuronal structure at a micrometer level is an exciting unresolved problem. Here we consider diffusion transverse to a bundle of fibers, and show theoretically, as well as using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements in a phantom made of parallel fibers mimicking axons, that the time dependent diffusion coefficient approaches its macroscopic limit slowly, in a (ln t)/. t fashion. The logarithmic singularity arises due to short range disorder in the fiber packing. We identify short range disorder in axonal fibers based on histological data from the splenium, and argue that the time dependent contribution to the overall diffusion coefficient from the extra-axonal water dominates that of the intra-axonal water. This dominance may explain the bias in measuring axon diameters in clinical settings. The short range disorder is also reflected in the asymptotically linear frequency dependence of the diffusion coefficient measured with oscillating gradients, in agreement with recent experiments. Our results relate the measured diffusion to the mesoscopic structure of neuronal tissue, uncovering the sensitivity of diffusion metrics to axonal arrangement within a fiber tract, and providing an alternative interpretation of axonal diameter mapping techniques.},

We focus on a broad range of diffusion times, up to 600 ms, covering diffusion length scales up to about 30 $\mu$m. We perform stimulated echo diffusion tensor imaging on 5 healthy volunteers and observe a relatively weak time-dependence in diffusion transverse to major fiber tracts. Remarkably, we also find notable time-dependence in the longitudinal direction. Comparing models of diffusion in ordered, confined and disordered media, we argue that the time-dependence in both directions can arise due to structural disorder, such as axonal beads in the longitudinal direction, and the random packing geometry of fibers within a bundle in the transverse direction. These time-dependent effects extend beyond a simple picture of Gaussian compartments, and may lead to novel markers that are specific to neuronal fiber geometry at the micrometer scale.},

Here we measure the time-dependence of the mean diffusivity {\$}D(t){\$} and mean kurtosis {\$}K(t){\$} in cortical gray matter and in 25 gray matter sub-regions, in 10 healthy subjects. Significant diffusivity and kurtosis time-dependence is observed for {\$}t=21.2{\$}-100 ms, and is characterized by a power-law tail {\$}\backslashsim t{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashvartheta{\}}{\$} with dynamical exponent {\$}\backslashvartheta{\$}. To interpret our measurements, we systematize the relevant scenarios and mechanisms for diffusion time-dependence in the brain. Using effective medium theory formalisms, we derive an exact relation between the power-law tails in {\$}D(t){\$} and {\$}K(t){\$}. The estimated power-law dynamical exponent {\$}\backslashvartheta\backslashsimeq1/2{\$} in both {\$}D(t){\$} and {\$}K(t){\$} is consistent with one-dimensional diffusion in the presence of randomly positioned restrictions along neurites. We analyze the short-range disordered statistics of synapses on axon collaterals in the cortex, and perform one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion restricted by permeable barriers with a similar randomness in their placement, to confirm the {\$}\backslashvartheta=1/2{\$} exponent. In contrast, the K$\backslash$"arger model of exchange is less consistent with the data since it does not capture the diffusivity time-dependence, and the estimated exchange time from {\$}K(t){\$} falls below our measured {\$}t{\$}-range. Although we cannot exclude exchange as a contributing factor, we argue that structural disorder along neurites is mainly responsible for the observed time-dependence of diffusivity and kurtosis. Our observation and theoretical interpretation of the {\$}t{\^{}}{\{}-1/2{\}}{\$} tail in {\$}D(t){\$} and {\$}K(t){\$} alltogether establish the sensitivity of a macroscopic MRI signal to micrometer-scale structural heterogeneities along neurites in human gray matter in vivo.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD) for the analysis of high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images using higher-order information provided by fibre orientation distributions (FODs) computed using spherical deconvolution. AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects.A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This work introduces a compartment-based model for apparent cell body (namely soma) and neurite density imaging (SANDI) using non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI). The existing conjecture in brain microstructure imaging through DW-MRI presents water diffusion in white (WM) and gray (GM) matter as restricted diffusion in neurites, modelled by infinite cylinders of null radius embedded in the hindered extra-neurite water. The extra-neurite pool in WM corresponds to water in the extra-axonal space, but in GM it combines water in the extra-cellular space with water in soma. While several studies showed that this microstructure model successfully describe DW-MRI data in WM and GM at b ​≤ ​3,000 ​s/mm2 (or 3 ​ms/$\mu$m2), it has been also shown to fail in GM at high b values (b≫3,000 ​s/mm2 or 3 ​ms/$\mu$m2). Here we hypothesise that the unmodelled soma compartment (i.e. cell body of any brain cell type: from neuroglia to neurons) may be responsible for this failure and propose SANDI as a new model of brain microstructure where soma of any brain cell type is explicitly included. We assess the effects of size and density of soma on the direction-averaged DW-MRI signal at high b values and the regime of validity of the model using numerical simulations and comparison with experimental data from mouse (bmax ​= ​40,000 ​s/mm2, or 40 ​ms/$\mu$m2) and human (bmax ​= ​10,000 ​s/mm2, or 10 ​ms/$\mu$m2) brain. We show that SANDI defines new contrasts representing complementary information on the brain cyto- and myelo-architecture. Indeed, we show maps from 25 healthy human subjects of MR soma and neurite signal fractions, that remarkably mirror contrasts of histological images of brain cyto- and myelo-architecture. Although still under validation, SANDI might provide new insight into tissue architecture by introducing a new set of biomarkers of potential great value for biomedical applications and pure neuroscience.},

abstract = {Voxel-based analysis of diffusion MRI data is increasingly popular. However, most white matter voxels contain contributions from multiple fibre populations (often referred to as crossing fibres), and therefore voxel-averaged quantitative measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy) are not fibre-specific and have poor interpretability. Using higher-order diffusion models, parameters related to fibre density can be extracted for individual fibre populations within each voxel (‘fixels'), and recent advances in statistics enable the multi-subject analysis of such data. However, investigating within-voxel microscopic fibre density alone does not account for macroscopic differences in the white matter morphology (e.g. the calibre of a fibre bundle). In this work, we introduce a novel method to investigate the latter, which we call fixel-based morphometry (FBM). To obtain a more complete measure related to the total number of white matter axons, information from both within-voxel microscopic fibre density and macroscopic morphology must be combined. We therefore present the FBM method as an integral piece within a comprehensive fixel-based analysis framework to investigate measures of fibre density, fibre-bundle morphology (cross-section), and a combined measure of fibre density and cross-section. We performed simulations to demonstrate the proposed measures using various transformations of a numerical fibre bundle phantom. Finally, we provide an example of such an analysis by comparing a clinical patient group to a healthy control group, which demonstrates that all three measures provide distinct and complementary information. By capturing information from both sources, the combined fibre density and cross-section measure is likely to be more sensitive to certain pathologies and more directly interpretable.},

Direct measurement of tissue microstructure of this kind using diffusion MRI offers a new class of biomarkers that give more specific information about tissue than measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging. Most existing techniques for axon diameter mapping assume a single axon orientation in the tissue model, which limits their application to only the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as the corpus callosum, where the single orientation assumption is a reasonable one. However, fiber crossings and other complex configurations are widespread in the brain. In such areas, the existing techniques will fail to provide useful axon diameter indices for any of the individual fiber populations. We propose a novel crossing fiber tissue model to enable axon diameter mapping in voxels with crossing fibers. We show in simulation that the technique can provide robust axon diameter estimates in a two-fiber crossing with the crossing angle as small as 45 degrees. Using ex vivo imaging data, we further demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by establishing reasonable axon diameter indices in the crossing region at the interface of the cingulum and the corpus callosum.},

In recent years, a variety of biophysical models have been proposed to associate particular patterns observed in the measured signal with specific microstructural properties of the neuronal tissue, such as axon diameter and fiber density. Despite very appealing results showing that the estimated microstructure indices agree very well with histological examinations, existing techniques require computationally very expensive non-linear procedures to fit the models to the data which, in practice, demand the use of powerful computer clusters for large-scale applications. In this work, we present a general framework for Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization (AMICO) and show how to re-formulate this class of techniques as convenient linear systems which, then, can be efficiently solved using very fast algorithms. We demonstrate this linearization of the fitting problem for two specific models, i.e. ActiveAx and NODDI, providing a very attractive alternative for parameter estimation in those techniques; however, the AMICO framework is general and flexible enough to work also for the wider space of microstructure imaging methods. Results demonstrate that AMICO represents an effective means to accelerate the fit of existing techniques drastically (up to four orders of magnitude faster) while preserving accuracy and precision in the estimated model parameters (correlation above 0.9). We believe that the availability of such ultrafast algorithms will help to accelerate the spread of microstructure imaging to larger cohorts of patients and to study a wider spectrum of neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Axonal degeneration is a major determinant of permanent neurological impairment during multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to the variable course of clinical disease and the heterogeneity of MS lesions, the mechanisms governing axonal degeneration may differ between disease stages. While the etiology of MS remains elusive, there now exist potential prognostic biomarkers that can predict the conversion to clinically definite MS. Specialized imaging techniques identifying axonal injury and drop-out are becoming established in clinical practice as a predictive measure of MS progression, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, these imaging techniques are still being debated as predictive biomarkers since controversy surrounds their lesion-specific association with expanded disability status scale (EDSS). A more promising diagnostic measure of axonal degeneration has been argued for the detection of reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and Creatine ratios via magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging, but again fail with its specificity for predicting actual axonal degeneration. Greater accuracy of predictive biomarkers is therefore warranted and may include CSF neurofilament light chain (NF-L) and neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) levels, for progressive MS. Furthermore, defining the molecular mechanisms that occur during the neurodegenerative changes in the various subgroups of MS may in fact prove vital for the future development of efficacious neuroprotective therapies. The clinical translation of a combined Na+ and Ca2+ channel blocker may lead to the establishment of a bona fide neuroprotective agent for the treatment of progressive MS. However, more specific therapeutic targets to limit axonal damage in MS need investigation and may include such integral axonal proteins such as the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a molecule which upon post-translational modification may propagate axonal degeneration in MS. In this review, we discuss the current clinical determinants of axonal damage in MS and consider the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may initiate these neurodegenerative changes. In particular we highlight the therapeutic candidates that may formulate novel therapeutic strategies to limit axonal degeneration and EDSS during progressive MS.},

abstract = {In multiple sclerosis, a common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, immune-mediated axon damage is responsible for permanent neurological deficits. How axon damage is initiated is not known. Here we use in vivo imaging to identify a previously undescribed variant of axon damage in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. This process, termed 'focal axonal degeneration' (FAD), is characterized by sequential stages, beginning with focal swellings and progressing to axon fragmentation. Notably, most swollen axons persist unchanged for several days, and some recover spontaneously. Early stages of FAD can be observed in axons with intact myelin sheaths. Thus, contrary to the classical view, demyelination-a hallmark of multiple sclerosis-is not a prerequisite for axon damage. Instead, focal intra-axonal mitochondrial pathology is the earliest ultrastructural sign of damage, and it precedes changes in axon morphology. Molecular imaging and pharmacological experiments show that macrophage-derived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) can trigger mitochondrial pathology and initiate FAD. Indeed, neutralization of ROS and RNS rescues axons that have already entered the degenerative process. Finally, axonal changes consistent with FAD can be detected in acute human multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, our data suggest that inflammatory axon damage might be spontaneously reversible and thus a potential target for therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Axonal beading, or the formation of a series of swellings along the axon, and retraction are commonly observed shape transformations that precede axonal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative conditions. The mechanisms driving these morphological transformations are poorly understood. Here, we report controlled experiments that can induce either beading or retraction and follow the time evolution of these responses. By making quantitative analysis of the shape modes under different conditions, measurement of membrane tension, and using theoretical considerations, we argue that membrane tension is the main driving force that pushes cytosol out of the axon when microtubules are degraded, causing axonal thinning. Under pharmacological perturbation, atrophy is always retrograde, and this is set by a gradient in the microtubule stability. The nature of microtubule depolymerization dictates the type of shape transformation, vis-{\`{a}}-vis beading or retraction. Elucidating the mechanisms of these shape transformations may facilitate development of strategies to prevent or arrest axonal atrophy due to neurodegenerative conditions.},

abstract = {Focal demyelinated plaques in white matter, which are the hallmark of multiple sclerosis pathology, only partially explain the patient's clinical deficits. We thus analysed global brain pathology in multiple sclerosis, focusing on the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and the cortex. Autopsy tissue from 52 multiple sclerosis patients (acute, relapsing-remitting, primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and from 30 controls was analysed using quantitative morphological techniques. New and active focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the white matter were mainly present in patients with acute and relapsing multiple sclerosis, while diffuse injury of the NAWM and cortical demyelination were characteristic hallmarks of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Cortical demyelination and injury of the NAWM, reflected by diffuse axonal injury with profound microglia activation, occurred on the background of a global inflammatory response in the whole brain and meninges. There was only a marginal correlation between focal lesion load in the white matter and diffuse white matter injury, or cortical pathology, respectively. Our data suggest that multiple sclerosis starts as a focal inflammatory disease of the CNS, which gives rise to circumscribed demyelinated plaques in the white matter. With chronicity, diffuse inflammation accumulates throughout the whole brain, and is associated with slowly progressive axonal injury in the NAWM and cortical demyelination. {\textcopyright} The Author (2005).

abstract = {White matter dementia (WMD) is a syndrome introduced in 1988 to highlight the potential of cerebral white matter disorders to produce cognitive loss of sufficient severity to qualify as dementia. Neurologists have long understood that such a syndrome can occur, but the dominance of gray matter as the locus of higher function has strongly directed neurobehavioral inquiry to the cerebral cortex while white matter has received less attention. Contemporary neuroimaging has been crucial in enabling the recognition of white matter abnormalities in a host of disorders, and the correlation of these changes with cognitive performance. Comprising about half the brain, white matter is prominently or exclusively involved in well over 100 disorders, in each of which white matter dysfunction can potentially cause or contribute to dementia. Neuropsychological findings from ten categories of white matter disorder lead to a convergence of findings that document remarkable neurobehavioral commonality among the dementias produced. More recently, the syndrome of mild cognitive dysfunction (MCD) has been introduced to expand the concept of WMD by proposing a precursor syndrome related to early white matter neuropathology. WMD and MCD inform the understanding of how white matter contributes to normal and abnormal cognition, and the specific neuroanatomic focus of these syndromes may enhance the diagnosis and treatment of many disabling disorders that do not primarily implicate the cerebral cortex. Forming essential connections within widely distributed neural networks, white matter is critical for rapid and efficient information transfer that complements the information processing of gray matter. As neuroimaging continues to advance, further information on white matter structure can be expected, and behavioral neurology will play a central role in elucidating the functional significance of these emerging data. By emphasizing the contribution of myelinated systems to higher function, the study of white matter and cognition represents investigation of the basic neuroscience of human behavior. {\textcopyright} 2012, SAGE Publications.

abstract = {We review, systematize and discuss models of diffusion in neuronal tissue, by putting them into an overarching physical context of coarse-graining over an increasing diffusion length scale. From this perspective, we view research on quantifying brain microstructure as occurring along three major avenues. The first avenue focusses on transient, or time-dependent, effects in diffusion. These effects signify the gradual coarse-graining of tissue structure, which occurs qualitatively differently in different brain tissue compartments. We show that transient effects contain information about the relevant length scales for neuronal tissue, such as the packing correlation length for neuronal fibers, as well as the degree of structural disorder along the neurites. The second avenue corresponds to the long-time limit, when the observed signal can be approximated as a sum of multiple nonexchanging anisotropic Gaussian components. Here, the challenge lies in parameter estimation and in resolving its hidden degeneracies. The third avenue employs multiple diffusion encoding techniques, able to access information not contained in the conventional diffusion propagator. We conclude with our outlook on future directions that could open exciting possibilities for designing quantitative markers of tissue physiology and pathology, based on methods of studying mesoscopic transport in disordered systems.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become one of the most popular MRI techniques in brain research, as well as in clinical practice. The number of brain studies with DTI is growing steadily and, over the last decade, has produced more than 700 publications. Diffusion tensor imaging enables visualization and characterization of white matter fascicli in two and three dimensions. Since the introduction of this methodology in 1994, it has been used to study the white matter architecture and integrity of the normal and diseased brains (multiple sclerosis, stroke, aging, dementia, schizophrenia, etc.). Although it provided image contrast that was not available with routine MR techniques, unique information on white matter and 3D visualization of neuronal pathways, many questions were raised regarding the origin of the DTI signal. Diffusion tensor imaging is constantly validated, challenged, and developed in terms of acquisition scheme, image processing, analysis, and interpretation. While DTI offers a powerful tool to study and visualize white matter, it suffers from inherent artifacts and limitations. The partial volume effect and the inability of the model to cope with non-Gaussian diffusion are its two main drawbacks. Nevertheless, when combined with functional brain mapping, DTI provides an efficient tool for comprehensive, noninvasive, functional anatomy mapping of the human brain. This review summarizes the development of DTI in the last decade with respect to the specificity and utility of the technique in radiology and anatomy studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Humana Press Inc.},

abstract = {Background: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Results: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called "ImageJ2" in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. Conclusions: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.},

For physical phantoms, we discuss the essential requirements and relevant characteristics of both the (NMR visible) liquid and (NMR invisible) phantom materials that induce relevant microstructural features detectable via MRI, based on diffusion, intra-voxel incoherent motion, magnetization transfer or magnetic susceptibility weighted contrast. In particular, for diffusion MRI, many useful phantoms have been proposed, ranging from simple liquids to advanced biomimetic phantoms consisting of hollow or plain microfibers and capillaries. For numerical phantoms, the focus is on Monte Carlo simulations of random walk, for which the basic principles, along with useful criteria to check and potential pitfalls are reviewed, in addition to a literature overview highlighting recent advances. While many phantoms exist already, the current review aims to stimulate further research in the field and to address remaining needs.},

abstract = {Development of therapies for neurological disorders depends on our ability to non-invasively diagnose and monitor the progression of underlying pathologies at the cellular level. Physics and physiology limit the resolution of human MRI to millimeters, orders of magnitude coarser than cell dimensions. Bridging this resolution gap requires identifying specific cellular-level features that are reflected in the macroscopic MRI measurement. Here we uncover the sensitivity of diffusion MRI to the micrometer-scale axonal caliber variations or swelling, by identifying a specific power-law time-dependence of water diffusion coefficient along white matter axons. The power-law exponent 1/2 is found both numerically, using Monte Carlo simulations in realistic substrates created from 3-dimensional electron microscopy images of mouse brain corpus callosum, and experimentally, in 15 healthy subjects on a clinical scanner. Our statistical analysis confirms the short-range disorder in the swelling placement, which theoretically yields the observed value of the power-law exponent. By modifying our numerical substrates, we also exclude the competing effects of axonal undulations and of the mitochondria on the observed time dependence. Our results offer the exciting ability to probe micrometer-level axonal swelling and beading, a hallmark of pathological changes in diseases such as Alzheimer's or traumatic brain injury, with a clinically feasible MRI technique with a millimeter-level resolution.},

abstract = {At the current resolution of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), research groups agree that there are between one third to two thirds of imag- ing voxels in the human brain whitematter that contain fiber crossing bundles. This thesis tackles the important problem of recovering crossing fiber bundles from DW- MRI measurements. The main goal is to overcome the limitations of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). It is well-known that imaging voxels where there are multiple fiber crossings produce a non-Gaussian DW signal. This is precisely where DTI is lim- ited due to the intrinsic Gaussian assumption of the technique. Hence, this thesis is dedicated to the development of local reconstructionmethods, segmentation and trac- tography algorithms able to infermultiple fiber crossing fromDW-MRI data. To do so, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is used to measure DW images along several directions. Q-ball imaging (QBI) is a recent suchHARDI technique that reconstructs the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF), a spherical func- tion that has its maxima aligned with the underlying fiber directions at every voxel. QBI and the diffusion ODF will play a central role in this thesis. There are many original contributions in this thesis. First, we propose a robust estimation of the HARDI signal using a closed-form regularization algorithm based on the spherical harmonics. Then, we estimate the apparent coefficient coefficient (ADC) to study HARDI anisotropy measures and to discriminate voxels with under- lying isotropic, single fiber andmultiple fiber distributions. Next, we develop a linear, robust and analytical QBI solution using the spherical harmonic basis, which is used in a newstatistical region-based active contour algorithmto segment importantwhite matter fiber bundles. In addition, we develop a new spherical deconvolution sharp- ening method that transforms the diffusion q-ball ODF into a fiber ODF. Finally, we propose a new deterministic tractography algorithm and a new probabilistic trac- tography algorithmexploiting the full distribution of the fiber ODF. Overall, we show local reconstruction, segmentation and tracking results on complex fiber regions with known fiber crossing on simulated HARDI data, on a biological phantomand onmul- tiple human brain datasets. Most current DTI based methods neglect these complex fibers, which might lead to wrong interpretations of the brain anatomy and function- ing. xv},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel deformable registration algorithm for diffusion tensor MR images that enables explicit optimization of tensor reorientation. The optimization seeks a piecewise affine transformation that divides the image domain into uniform regions and transform each region affinely. The objective function captures both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation across region boundaries. The image similarity enables explicit orientation optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures examined: the anterior thalamic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, the corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts and the genu and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The alignment of white matter structures is assessed using a novel scheme of computing distances between the corresponding fiber bundles derived from tractography. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The complex transverse water proton magnetization subject to diffusion-encoding magnetic field gradient pulses in a heterogeneous medium can be modeled by the multiple compartment Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation. Under the assumption of negligible water exchange between compartments, the time-dependent apparent diffusion coefficient can be directly computed from the solution of a diffusion equation subject to a time-dependent Neumann boundary condition. This paper describes a publicly available MATLAB toolbox called SpinDoctor that can be used 1) to solve the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation in order to simulate the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging signal; 2) to solve a diffusion partial differential equation to obtain directly the apparent diffusion coefficient; 3) to compare the simulated apparent diffusion coefficient with a short-time approximation formula. The partial differential equations are solved by P1 finite elements combined with built-in MATLAB routines for solving ordinary differential equations. The finite element mesh generation is performed using an external package called Tetgen. SpinDoctor provides built-in options of including 1) spherical cells with a nucleus; 2) cylindrical cells with a myelin layer; 3) an extra-cellular space enclosed either a) in a box or b) in a tight wrapping around the cells; 4) deformation of canonical cells by bending and twisting; 5) permeable membranes; Built-in diffusion-encoding pulse sequences include the Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo and the Oscillating Gradient Spin Echo. We describe in detail how to use the SpinDoctor toolbox. We validate SpinDoctor simulations using reference signals computed by the Matrix Formalism method. We compare the accuracy and computational time of SpinDoctor simulations with Monte-Carlo simulations and show significant speed-up of SpinDoctor over Monte-Carlo simulations in complex geometries. We also illustrate several extensions of SpinDoctor functionalities, including the incorporation of T2 relaxation, the simulation of non-standard diffusion-encoding sequences, as well as the use of externally generated geometrical meshes.},

abstract = {The Bloch–Torrey equation describes the evolution of the spin (usually water proton) magnetization under the influence of applied magnetic field gradients and is commonly used in numerical simulations for diffusion MRI and NMR. Microscopic heterogeneity inside the imaging voxel is modeled by interfaces inside the simulation domain, where a discontinuity in the magnetization across the interfaces is produced via a permeability coefficient on the interfaces. To avoid having to simulate on a computational domain that is the size of an entire imaging voxel, which is often much larger than the scale of the microscopic heterogeneity as well as the mean spin diffusion displacement, smaller representative volumes of the imaging medium can be used as the simulation domain. In this case, the exterior boundaries of a representative volume either must be far away from the initial positions of the spins or suitable boundary conditions must be found to allow the movement of spins across these exterior boundaries. Many approaches have been taken to solve the Bloch–Torrey equation but an efficient high performance computing framework is still missing. In this paper, we present formulations of the interface as well as the exterior boundary conditions that are computationally efficient and suitable for arbitrary order finite elements and parallelization. In particular, the formulations are based on the partition of unity concept which allows for a discontinuous solution across interfaces conforming with the mesh with weak enforcement of real (in the case of interior interfaces) and artificial (in the case of exterior boundaries) permeability conditions as well as an operator splitting for the exterior boundary conditions. The method is straightforward to implement and it is available in FEniCS for moderate-scale simulations and in FEniCS-HPC for large-scale simulations. The order of accuracy of the resulting method is validated in numerical tests and a good scalability is shown for the parallel implementation. We show that the simulated dMRI signals offer good approximations to reference signals in cases where the latter are available and we performed simulations for a realistic model of a neuron to show that the method can be used for complex geometries.},

abstract = {The numerical simulation of the diffusion MRI signal arising from complex tissue micro-structures is helpful for understanding and interpreting imaging data as well as for designing and optimizing MRI sequences. The discretization of the Bloch-Torrey equation by finite elements is a more recently developed approach for this purpose, in contrast to random walk simulations, which has a longer history. While finite element discretization is more difficult to implement than random walk simulations, the approach benefits from a long history of theoretical and numerical developments by the mathematical and engineering communities. In particular, software packages for the automated solutions of partial differential equations using finite element discretization, such as FEniCS, are undergoing active support and development. However, because diffusion MRI simulation is a relatively new application area, there is still a gap between the simulation needs of the MRI community and the available tools provided by finite element software packages. In this paper, we address two potential difficulties in using FEniCS for diffusion MRI simulation. First, we simplified software installation by the use of FEniCS containers that are completely portable across multiple platforms. Second, we provide a portable simulation framework based on Python and whose code is open source. This simulation framework can be seamlessly integrated with cloud computing resources such as Google Colaboratory notebooks working on a web browser or with Google Cloud Platform with MPI parallelization. We show examples illustrating the accuracy, the computational times, and parallel computing capabilities. The framework contributes to reproducible science and open-source software in computational diffusion MRI with the hope that it will help to speed up method developments and stimulate research collaborations.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) yields parameters sensitive to brain tissue microstructure. A structurally important aspect of this microstructure is the myelin wrapping around the axons. This paper investigated the forward problem concerning whether water exchange via the spiraling structure of the myelin can meaningfully contribute to the signal in dMRI. Monte Carlo simulations were performed in a system with intra-axonal, myelin, and extra-axonal compartments. Diffusion in the myelin was simulated as a spiral wrapping the axon, with a custom number of wraps. Exchange (or intra-axonal residence) times were analyzed for various number of wraps and axon diameters. Pulsed gradient sequences were employed to simulate the dMRI signal, which was analyzed using different methods. Diffusional kurtosis imaging analysis yielded the radial diffusivity (RD) and radial kurtosis (RK), while the two-compartment K{\"{a}}rger model yielded estimates the intra-axonal volume fraction ($\nu$ic) and exchange time ($\tau$). Results showed that $\tau$ was on the sub-second level for geometries with axon diameters below 1.0 $\mu$m and less than eight wraps. Otherwise, exchange was negligible compared to typical experimental durations, with $\tau$ of seconds or longer. In situations where exchange influenced the signal, estimates of RK and $\nu$ic increased with the number of wraps, while RD decreased. $\tau$ estimates from simulated signals were in agreement with predicted ones. In conclusion, exchange through spiraling myelin permits sub-second $\tau$ for small diameters and low number of wraps. Such conditions may arise in the developing brain or in neurodegenerative disease, and thus the results could aid the interpretation of dMRI studies.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI may enable non-invasive mapping of axonal microstructure. Most approaches infer axon diameters from effects of time-dependent diffusion on the diffusion-weighted MR signal by modeling axons as straight cylinders. Axons do not, however, propagate in straight trajectories, and so far the impact of the axonal trajectory on diameter estimation has been insufficiently investigated. Here, we employ a toy model of axons, which we refer to as the undulating thin fiber model, to analyze the impact of undulating trajectories on the time dependence of diffusion. We study time-dependent diffusion in the frequency domain and characterize the diffusion spectrum by its height, width, and low-frequency behavior (power law exponent). Results show that microscopic orientation dispersion of the thin fibers is the main parameter that determines the characteristics of the diffusion spectra. At lower frequencies (longer diffusion times), straight cylinders and undulating thin fibers can have virtually identical spectra. If the straight-cylinder assumption is used to interpret data from undulating thin axons, the diameter is overestimated by an amount proportional to the undulation amplitude and microscopic orientation dispersion of the fibers. At higher frequencies (shorter diffusion times), spectra from cylinders and undulating thin fibers differ. The low-frequency behavior of the spectra from the undulating thin fibers may also differ from that of cylinders, because the power law exponent of undulating fibers can reach values below 2 for experimentally relevant frequency ranges. In conclusion, we argue that the non-straight nature of axonal trajectories should not be overlooked when analyzing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.},

abstract = {Probing microstructure with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) on a scale orders of magnitude below the imaging resolution relies on biophysical modelling of the signal response in the tissue. The vast majority of these biophysical models of diffusion in white matter assume that the measured dMRI signal is the sum of the signals emanating from each of the constituent compartments, each of which exhibits a distinct behaviour in the b-value and/or orientation domain. Many of these models further assume that the dMRI behaviour of the oriented compartments (e.g. the intra-axonal space) is identical between distinct fibre populations, at least at the level of a single voxel. This implicitly assumes that any potential biological differences between fibre populations are negligible, at least as far as is measurable using dMRI. Here, we validate this assumption by means of a voxel-wise, model-free signal decomposition that, under the assumption above and in the absence of noise, is shown to be rank-1. We evaluate the effect size of signal components beyond this rank-1 representation and use permutation testing to assess their significance. We conclude that in the healthy adult brain, the dMRI signal is adequately represented by a rank-1 model, implying that biologically more realistic, but mathematically more complex fascicle-specific microstructure models do not capture statistically significant or anatomically meaningful structure, even in extended high-b diffusion MRI scans.},

SBEM produces high-resolution 3D data at the mesoscopic scale with good contrast of cellular membranes. We analysed selected samples from cingulum, corpus callosum, and perilesional cortex of sham-operated and traumatic brain injury (TBI) rats. Principal orientations produced by DTI and 3D-FT in all samples were in good agreement. Anisotropy values showed similar patterns of change in corresponding DTI and 3D-FT parameters in sham-operated and TBI rats. While DTI and 3D-FT anisotropy values were similar in grey matter, 3D-FT anisotropy values were consistently lower than fractional anisotropy values from DTI in white matter. We also evaluated the effect of resolution in 3D-FT analysis. Despite small angular differences in grey matter samples, lower resolution datasets provided reliable results, allowing for analysis of larger fields of view. Overall, 3D SBEM allows for more sophisticated validation studies of diffusion imaging contrast from a tissue microstructural perspective.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between the diffusion-weighted MRI signal and the arrangement of white matter fibers is fundamental for accurate voxel-wise reconstruction of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) and subsequent fiber tractography. Spherical deconvolution reconstruction techniques model the diffusion signal as the convolution of the FOD with a response function that represents the signal profile of a single fiber orientation. Thus, given the signal and a fiber response function, the FOD can be estimated in every imaging voxel by deconvolution. However, the selection of the appropriate response function remains relatively under-studied, and requires further validation. In this work, using 3D histologically defined FODs and the corresponding diffusion signal from three ex vivo squirrel monkey brains, we derive the ground truth response functions. We find that the histologically derived response functions differ from those conventionally used. Next, we find that response functions statistically vary across brain regions, which suggests that the practice of using the same kernel throughout the brain is not optimal. We show that different kernels lead to different FOD reconstructions, which in turn can lead to different tractography results depending on algorithmic parameters, with large variations in the accuracy of resulting reconstructions. Together, these results suggest there is room for improvement in estimating and understanding the relationship between the diffusion signal and the underlying FOD.},

In particular, techniques aimed at detecting MRI resonance frequency shifts originating from local variation in magnetic susceptibility and other sources have greatly improved the visualization of these structures. A recent theoretical study [He X, Yablonskiy DA (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:13558-13563] suggests that MRI resonance frequency may report not only on tissue composition, but also on microscopic compartmentalization of susceptibility inclusions and their orientation relative to the magnetic field. The proposed sensitivity to tissue structuremay greatly expand the information available with conventional MRI techniques. To investigate thispossibility,we studiedpostmortemtissuesamples from human corpus callosum with an experimental design that allowed separation of microstructural effects from confounding macrostructural effects. The results show that MRI resonance frequency does depend on microstructural orientation. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the resonance frequency shift suggests an origin related to anisotropic susceptibility effects rather than microscopic compartmentalization. This anisotropy, which has been shown to depend on molecular ordering, may provide valuable information about tissue molecular structure.},

abstract = {Frequency shift of gradient-echo MRI provides valuable information for assessing brain tissues. Recent studies suggest that the frequency and susceptibility contrast depend on white matter fiber orientation. However, the molecular underpinning of the orientation dependence is unclear. In this study, we investigated the orientation dependence of susceptibility of human brain in vivo and mouse brains ex vivo. The source of susceptibility anisotropy in white matter is likely to be myelin as evidenced by the loss of anisotropy in the dysmyelinating shiverer mouse brain. A biophysical model is developed to investigate the effect of the molecular susceptibility anisotropy of myelin components, especially myelin lipids, on the bulk anisotropy observed by MRI. This model provides a consistent interpretation of the orientation dependence of macroscopic magnetic susceptibility in normal mouse brain ex vivo and human brain in vivo and the microscopic origin of anisotropic susceptibility. It is predicted by the theoretical model and illustrated by the experimental data that the magnetic susceptibility of the white matter is least diamagnetic along the fiber direction. This relationship allows an efficient extraction of fiber orientation using susceptibility tensor imaging. These results suggest that anisotropy on the molecular level can be observed on the macroscopic level when the molecules are aligned in a highly ordered manner. Similar to the utilization of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy in elucidating molecular structures, imaging magnetic susceptibility anisotropy may also provide a useful tool for elucidating the microstructure of ordered biological tissues. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter fibers. The diffusion tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a voxel. However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple tensor fitting, q-space, and Q-ball imaging. However, each of these has inherent limitations. In this study, we propose a novel method for estimating the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution diffusion-weighted MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations present. We assume that all white matter fiber bundles in the brain share identical diffusion characteristics, thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion anisotropy to partial volume effects. The diffusion-weighted signal attenuation measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the convolution over the sphere of a response function (the diffusion-weighted attenuation profile for a typical fiber bundle) with the fiber orientation density function (ODF). The fiber ODF (the distribution of fiber orientations within the voxel) can therefore be obtained using spherical deconvolution. The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard 1.5-T clinical scanner. The technique can recover the fiber ODF in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as tractography. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Proper axonal and dendritic bundling is essential for the establishment of neuronal connections and the synchronization of synaptic inputs, respectively. Cell adhesion molecules of the L1-CAM (L1-cell adhesion molecule) family regulate axon guidance and fasciculation, neuron migration, dendrite morphology, and synaptic plasticity. It remains unclear how these molecules play so many different roles. Here we show that polarized axon-dendrite targeting of an avian L1-CAM protein, NgCAM (neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule), can regulate the switch of bundling of the two major compartments of rat hippocampal neurons. Using a new in-vitro model for studying neurite-neurite interactions, we found that expressed axonal NgCAM induced robust axonal bundling via the trans-homophilic interaction of immunoglobulin domains. Interestingly, dendritic bundling was induced by the dendritic targeting of NgCAM, caused by either deleting its fibronectin repeats or blocking activities of protein kinases. Consistent with the NgCAM results, expression of mouse L1-CAM also induced axonal bundling and blocking kinase activities disrupted its axonal targeting. Furthermore, the trans-homophilic interaction stabilized the bundle formation, probably through recruiting NgCAM proteins to contact sites and promoting guided axon outgrowth. Taken together, our results suggest that precise localization of L1-CAM is important for establishing proper cell-cell contacts in neural circuits. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {While axon fasciculation plays a key role in the development of neural networks, very little is known about its dynamics and the underlying biophysical mechanisms. In a model system composed of neurons grown ex vivo from explants of embryonic mouse olfactory epithelia, we observed that axons dynamically interact with each other through their shafts, leading to zippering and unzippering behavior that regulates their fasciculation. Taking advantage of this new preparation suitable for studying such interactions, we carried out a detailed biophysical analysis of zippering, occurring either spontaneously or induced by micromanipulations and pharmacological treatments. We show that zippering arises from the competition of axon-axon adhesion and mechanical tension in the axons, and provide the first quantification of the force of axon-axon adhesion. Furthermore, we introduce a biophysical model of the zippering dynamics, and we quantitatively relate the individual zipper properties to global characteristics of the developing axon network. Our study uncovers a new role of mechanical tension in neural development: the regulation of axon fasciculation.},

abstract = {In the fundamental process of neuronal path-finding, a growth cone at the tip of every neurite detects and follows multiple guidance cues regulating outgrowth and initiating directional changes. While the main focus of research lies on the cytoskeletal dynamics underlying growth cone advancement, we investigated collapse and retraction mechanisms in NG108-15 growth cones transiently transfected with mCherry-LifeAct and pCS2+/EMTB-3XGFP for filamentous actin and microtubules, respectively. Using fluorescence time lapse microscopy we could identify two distinct modes of growth cone collapse leading either to neurite retraction or to a controlled halt of neurite extension. In the latter case, lateral movement and folding of actin bundles (filopodia) confine microtubule extension and limit microtubule-based expansion processes without the necessity of a constantly engaged actin turnover machinery. We term this previously unreported second type fold collapse and suggest that it marks an intermediate-term mode of growth regulation closing the gap between full retraction and small scale fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Axon outgrowth and guidance to the proper target requires the coordination of filamentous (F)-actin and microtubules (MTs), the dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that promote shape change and locomotion. Over the past two decades, our knowledge of the many guidance cues, receptors, and downstream signaling cascades involved in neuronal outgrowth and guidance has increased dramatically. Less is known, however, about how those cascades of information converge and direct appropriate remodeling and interaction of cytoskeletal polymers, the ultimate effectors of movement and guidance. During development, much of the communication that occurs between environmental guidance cues and the cytoskeleton takes place at the growing tip of the axon, the neuronal growth cone. Several articles on this topic focus on the "input" to the growth cone, themyriad of receptor types, and their corresponding cognate ligands. Others investigate the signaling cascades initiated by receptors and propagated by second messenger pathways (i.e., kinases, phosphatases, GTPases). Ultimately, this plethora of information converges on proteins that associate directly with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The role of these cytoskeletal-associated proteins, aswell as the cytoskeleton itself in axon outgrowth and guidance, is the subject of this article. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {The ability of neurons to form a single axon and multiple dendrites underlies the directional flow of information transfer in the central nervous system. Dendrites and axons are molecularly and functionally distinct domains. Dendrites integrate synaptic inputs, triggering the generation of action potentials at the level of the soma. Action potentials then propagate along the axon, which makes presynaptic contacts onto target cells. This article reviews what is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of neurons to initiate and extend a single axon during development. Remarkably, neurons can polarize to form a single axon, multiple dendrites, and later establish functional synaptic contacts in reductionist in vitro conditions. This approach became, and remains, the dominant model to study axon initiation and growth and has yielded the identification of many molecules that regulate axon formation in vitro (Dotti et al. 1988). At present, only a few of the genes identified using in vitro approaches have been shown to be required for axon initiation and outgrowth in vivo. In vitro, axon initiation and elongation are largely intrinsic properties of neurons that are established in the absence of relevant extracellular cues. However, the importance of extracellular cues to axon initiation and outgrowth in vivo is emerging as a major theme in neural development (Barnes and Polleux 2009). In this article, we focus our attention on the extracellular cues and signaling pathways required in vivo for axon initiation and axon extension.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate the effect of realistic microstructural geometry on the susceptibility-weighted MR signal in white matter (WM), with application to demyelination. METHODS Previous work has modeled susceptibility-weighted signals under the assumption that axons are cylindrical. In this study, we explored the implications of this assumption by considering the effect of more realistic geometries. A three-compartment WM model incorporating relevant properties based on the literature was used to predict the MR signal. Myelinated axons were modeled with several cross-sectional geometries of increasing realism: nested circles, warped/elliptical circles, and measured axonal geometries from electron micrographs. Signal simulations from the different microstructural geometries were compared with measured signals from a cuprizone mouse model with varying degrees of demyelination. RESULTS Simulation results suggest that axonal geometry affects the MR signal. Predictions with realistic models were significantly different compared with circular models under the same microstructural tissue properties, for simulations with and without diffusion. CONCLUSION The geometry of axons affects the MR signal significantly. Literature estimates of myelin susceptibility, which are based on fitting biophysical models to the MR signal, are likely to be biased by the assumed geometry, as will any derived microstructural properties.

abstract = {The neuroimaging technique three-dimensional polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) provides a high-resolution reconstruction of nerve fibres in human post-mortem brains. The orientations of the fibres are derived from birefringence measurements of histological brain sections assuming that the nerve fibres - consisting of an axon and a surrounding myelin sheath - are uniaxial birefringent and that the measured optic axis is oriented in direction of the nerve fibres (macroscopic model). Although experimental studies support this assumption, the molecular structure of the myelin sheath suggests that the birefringence of a nerve fibre can be described more precisely by multiple optic axes oriented radially around the fibre axis (microscopic model). In this paper, we compare the use of the macroscopic and the microscopic model for simulating 3D-PLI by means of the Jones matrix formalism. The simulations show that the macroscopic model ensures a reliable estimation of the fibre orientations as long as the polarimeter does not resolve structures smaller than the diameter of single fibres. In the case of fibre bundles, polarimeters with even higher resolutions can be used without losing reliability. When taking the myelin density into account, the derived fibre orientations are considerably improved.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently-those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers-the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the CNS characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. Animal models that enable the study of remyelination in the context of ongoing inflammation are greatly needed for the development of novel therapies that target the pathological inhibitory cues inherent to the MS plaque microenvironment. We report the development of an innovative animal model combining cuprizone-mediated demyelination with transfer of myelin-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Characterization of this model reveals both Th1 and Th17 CD4(+) T cells infiltrate the CNS of cuprizone-fed mice, with infiltration of Th17 cells being more efficient. Infiltration correlates with impaired spontaneous remyelination as evidenced by myelin protein expression, immunostaining, and ultrastructural analysis. Electron microscopic analysis further reveals that demyelinated axons are preserved but reduced in caliber. Examination of the immune response contributing to impaired remyelination highlights a role for peripheral monocytes with an M1 phenotype. This study demonstrates the development of a novel animal model that recapitulates elements of the microenvironment of the MS plaque and reveals an important role for T cells and peripheral monocytes in impairing endogenous remyelination in vivo. This model could be useful for testing putative MS therapies designed to enhance remyelination in the setting of active inflammation, and may also facilitate modeling the pathophysiology of denuded axons, which has been a challenge in rodents because they typically remyelinate very quickly.},

Although intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease worldwide, the pathologic changes in ultrastructure during the acute and chronic phases of ICH are poorly described. In this study, transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the ultrastructure of ICH-induced pathology. ICH was induced in mice by an intrastriatal injection of collagenase. Pathologic changes were observed in the acute (3 days), subacute (6 days), and chronic (28 days) phases. Compared with sham animals, we observed various types of cell death in the injured striatum during the acute phase of ICH, including necrosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy. Different degrees of axon degeneration in the striatum were seen in the acute phase, and axonal demyelination was observed in the ipsilateral striatum and corpus callosum at late time points. In addition, phagocytes, resident microglia, and infiltrating monocyte-macrophages were present around red blood cells and degenerating neurons and were observed to engulf red blood cells and other debris. Many synapses appeared abnormal or were lost. This systematic analysis of the pathologic changes in ultrastructure after ICH in mice provides information that will be valuable for future ICH pathology studies.},

abstract = {Purpose To examine the effects of the reconstruction algorithm of magnitude images from multichannel diffusion MRI on fibre orientation estimation. Theory and Methods It is well established that the method used to combine signals from different coil elements in multichannel MRI can have an impact on the properties of the reconstructed magnitude image. Using a root-sum-of-squares approach results in a magnitude signal that follows an effective noncentral-$\chi$ distribution. As a result, the noise floor, the minimum measurable in the absence of any true signal, is elevated. This is particularly relevant for diffusion-weighted MRI, where the signal attenuation is of interest. Results In this study, we illustrate problems that such image reconstruction characteristics may cause in the estimation of fibre orientations, both for model-based and model-free approaches, when modern 32-channel coils are used. We further propose an alternative image reconstruction method that is based on sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and preserves the Rician nature of the single-channel, magnitude MR signal. We show that for the same k-space data, root-sum-of-squares can cause excessive overfitting and reduced precision in orientation estimation compared with the SENSE-based approach. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of choosing the appropriate image reconstruction method for tractography studies that use multichannel receiver coils for diffusion MRI acquisition.

abstract = {Focal microinjection of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, reduces neurological deficits and tissue loss after spinal cord injury (SCI). Significant sparing of white matter (WM) is seen at 8 weeks after injury and is correlated to a reduction in functional deficits. To determine whether TTX exerts an acute effect on WM pathology, Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to a standardized weight-drop contusion at T8 (10 gm x 2.5 cm). TTX (0. 15 nmol) or vehicle solution was injected into the injury site 5 or 15 min later. At 4 and 24 hr, ventromedial WM from the injury epicenter was compared by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. By 4 hr after SCI, axonal counts revealed reduced numbers of axons and significant loss of large ({\textgreater}/=5 micrometer)-diameter axons. TTX treatment significantly reduced the loss of large-diameter axons. In addition, TTX significantly attenuated axoplasmic pathology at both 4 and 24 hr after injury. In particular, the development of extensive periaxonal spaces in the large-diameter axons was reduced with TTX treatment. In contrast, there was no significant effect of TTX on the loss of WM glia after SCI. Thus, the long-term effects of TTX in reducing WM loss after spinal cord injury appear to be caused by the reduction of acute axonal pathology. These results support the hypothesis that TTX-sensitive sodium channels at axonal nodes of Ranvier play a significant role in the secondary injury of WM after SCI.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a statistical model for the tridimensional diffusion MRI signal at each voxel that describes the signal arising from each tissue compartment in each voxel. THEORY AND METHODS: In prior work, a statistical model of the apparent diffusion coefficient was shown to well-characterize the diffusivity and heterogeneity of the mono-directional diffusion MRI signal. However, this model was unable to characterize the three-dimensional anisotropic diffusion observed in the brain. We introduce a new model that extends the statistical distribution representation to be fully tridimensional, in which apparent diffusion coefficients are extended to be diffusion tensors. The set of compartments present at a voxel is modeled by a finite sum of unimodal continuous distributions of diffusion tensors. Each distribution provides measures of each compartment microstructural diffusivity and heterogeneity. RESULTS: The ability to estimate the tridimensional diffusivity and heterogeneity of multiple fascicles and of free diffusion is demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Our novel tissue model allows for the characterization of the intra-voxel orientational heterogeneity, a prerequisite for accurate tractography while also characterizing the overall tridimensional diffusivity and heterogeneity of each tissue compartment. The model parameters can be estimated from short duration acquisitions. The diffusivity and heterogeneity microstructural parameters may provide novel indicator of the presence of disease or injury.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Jelescu and Budde. Diffusion MRI is arguably the method of choice for characterizing white matter microstructure in vivo. Over the typical duration of diffusion encoding, the displacement of water molecules is conveniently on a length scale similar to that of the underlying cellular structures. Moreover, water molecules in white matter are largely compartmentalized which enables biologically-inspired compartmental diffusion models to characterize and quantify the true biological microstructure. A plethora of white matter models have been proposed. However, overparameterization and mathematical fitting complications encourage the introduction of simplifying assumptions that vary between different approaches. These choices impact the quantitative estimation of model parameters with potential detriments to their biological accuracy and promised specificity. First, we review biophysical white matter models in use and recapitulate their underlying assumptions and realms of applicability. Second, we present up-to-date efforts to validate parameters estimated from biophysical models. Simulations and dedicated phantoms are useful in assessing the performance of models when the ground truth is known. However, the biggest challenge remains the validation of the "biological accuracy" of estimated parameters. Complementary techniques such as microscopy of fixed tissue specimens have facilitated direct comparisons of estimates of white matter fiber orientation and densities. However, validation of compartmental diffusivities remains challenging, and complementary MRI-based techniques such as alternative diffusion encodings, compartment-specific contrast agents and metabolites have been used to validate diffusion models. Finally, white matter injury and disease pose additional challenges to modeling, which are also discussed. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of models and their validation and to stimulate further research in the field to solve the remaining open questions and converge toward consensus.},

abstract = {This paper presents Bingham-NODDI, a clinically-feasible technique for estimating the anisotropic orientation dispersion of neurites. Direct quantification of neurite morphology on clinical scanners was recently realised by a diffusion MRI technique known as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). However in its current form NODDI cannot estimate anisotropic orientation dispersion, which is widespread in the brain due to common fanning and bending of neurites. This work proposes Bingham-NODDI that extends the NODDI formalism to address this limitation. Bingham-NODDI characterises anisotropic orientation dispersion by utilising the Bingham distribution to model neurite orientation distribution. The new model estimates the extent of dispersion about the dominant orientation, separately along the primary and secondary dispersion orientations. These estimates are subsequently used to estimate the overall dispersion about the dominant orientation and the dispersion anisotropy. We systematically evaluate the ability of the new model to recover these key parameters of anisotropic orientation dispersion with standard NODDI protocol, both in silico and in vivo. The results demonstrate that the parameters of the proposed model can be estimated without additional acquisition requirements over the standard NODDI protocol. Thus anisotropic dispersion can be determined and has the potential to be used as a marker for normal brain development and ageing or in pathology. We additionally find that the original NODDI model is robust to the effects of anisotropic orientation dispersion, when the quantification of anisotropic dispersion is not of interest.},

abstract = {Local collision avoidance algorithms in crowd simulation often ignore agents beyond a neighborhood of a certain size. This cutoff can result in sharp changes in trajectory when large groups of agents enter or exit these neighborhoods. In this work, we exploit the insight that exact collision avoidance is not necessary between agents at such large distances, and propose a novel algorithm for extending existing collision avoidance algorithms to perform approximate, long-range collision avoidance. Our formulation performs long-range collision avoidance for distant agent groups to efficiently compute trajectories that are smoother than those obtained with state-of-the-art techniques and at faster rates. Another issue often sidestepped in existing work is that discrete and continuum collision avoidance algorithms have different regions of applicability. For example, low-density crowds cannot be modeled as a continuum, while high-density crowds can be expensive to model using discrete methods. We formulate a hybrid technique for crowd simulation which can accurately and efficiently simulate crowds at any density with seamless transitions between continuum and discrete representations. Our approach blends results from continuum and discrete algorithms, based on local density and velocity variance. In addition to being robust across a variety of group scenarios, it is also highly efficient, running at interactive rates for thousands of agents on portable systems.},

abstract = {The development of a brain from its simple beginnings in the embryo to the extraordinarily complex fully-functional adult structure is a truly remarkable process. Understanding how it occurs remains a formidable challenge despite enormous advances over the last century and current intense world-wide scientific research. A greater knowledge of how nervous systems construct themselves will bring huge benefits for human health and future technologies. Unravelling the mechanisms that lead to the development of healthy brains should help scientists tackle currently incurable diseases of the nervous system such as autism, epilepsy and schizophrenia (to name but a few), discover more about the processes that cause the uncontrolled growth associated with cancer and develop possible treatments.Building Brains provides a highly visual and readily accessible introduction to the main events that occur during neural development and the mechanisms by which they occur. Aimed at undergraduate students and postgraduates new to the field, who may not have a background in neuroscience and/or molecular genetics, it explains how cells in the early embryo first become neural, how their proliferation is controlled, what regulates the types of neural cells they become, how neurons connect to each other, how these connections are later refined under the influence of neural activity including that arising from experience, and why some neurons normally die.Key Features:A concise illustrated guide focusing on the core elements of current understanding of neural development, emphasising common principles underlying developmental mechanisms and supplemented by suggestions for further reading.Text boxes throughout provide further detail on selected major advances, issues of particular uncertainty or controversy and examples of human diseases that result from abnormal development.A balanced mammalian/non-mammalian perspective, drawing on examples from model organisms including the fruit fly, nematode worm, frog, zebrafish, chick, mouse, ferret, cat, monkey and human, and emphasising mechanisms that are conserved across species.Introduces the methods for studying neural development including genetics, transgenic technologies, advanced microscopy and computational modeling, allowing the reader to understand the main evidence underlying research advances.Student-friendly, full colour artwork reinforces important concepts; an extensive glossary and definitions in page margins help readers from different backgrounds; chapter summaries stress important points and aid revision.Associated Website includes a complete set of figures from the textbook.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for crowd simulation based on a biologically motivated space colonization algorithm. This algorithm was originally introduced to model leaf venation patterns and the branching architecture of trees. It operates by simulating the competition for space between growing veins or branches. Adapted to crowd modeling, the space colonization algorithm focuses on the competition for space among moving agents. Several behaviors observed in real crowds, including collision avoidance, relationship of crowd density and speed of agents, and the formation of lanes in which people follow each other, are emergent properties of the algorithm. The proposed crowd modeling method is free-of-collision, simple to implement, robust, computationally efficient, and suited to the interactive control of simulated crowds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We introduce a class of biologically−motivated algorithms for generating leaf venation patterns. These algorithms simulate the interplay between three processes: (1) development of veins towards hormone (auxin) sources embedded in the leaf blade; (2) modification of the hormone source distribution by the proximity of veins; and (3) modification of both the vein pattern and source distribution by leaf growth. These processes are formulated in terms of iterative geometric operations on sets of points that represent vein nodes and auxin sources. In addition, a vein connection graph is maintained to determine vein widths. The effective implementation of the algorithms relies on the use of space subdivision (Voronoi diagrams) and time coherence between iteration steps. Depending on the specification details and parameters used, the algorithms can simulate many types of venation patterns, both open (tree−like) and closed (with loops). Applications of the presented algorithms include texture and detailed structure generation for image synthesis purposes, and modeling of morphogenetic processes in support of biological research.},

The simulation procedure, employing a continuous step length distribution that ensures rapid and accurate convergence, was validated by comparison with exact results for cylindrical and spherical obstructions on 2D and 3D lattices. The exact results were computed with Rayleigh's multipole method, which also was used to derive a new analytical formula for the obstruction factor of parallel cylinders on a hexagonal lattice, of much higher accuracy than the commonly used approximations. Random-flight simulations were used to assess the accuracy of existing mean-field approximations for the obstruction factors of orientationally ordered nonspherical objects. Due to a near-cancellation of errors, the mean-field result accurately describes the obstruction effect on the trace of the diffusion tensor, as measured in isotropic systems, up to moderately high volume fractions. In contrast, the diffusion anisotropy, a sensitive indicator of microstructure in anisotropic fluids, is accurately predicted by mean-field theory only at low volume fractions.},

We examine previous approaches to the problem and then propose a scheme based on the coherency of an auxiliary data structure imposed on the original object domain. After investigating both simple spatial enumeration and a hybrid octree approach, we developed 3DDDA, a 3D line generator for efficient traversing of both structures. 3DDDA provides an order of magnitude improvement in processing speed compared to other known ray-tracing methods. Processing time is found to be virtually independent of the number of objects involved in the scene. For large numbers of objects, this method actully becomes faster than scan-line methods. To remove jags from edges, a scheme for identifying edge orientation and distance from pixel center to true edge has been implemented. The time required for antialiasing depends on the total length of the edges encountered, but it is normally only a fractional addition to the time needed to produce the scene without antialiasing.},

abstract = {Some microstructure parameters, such as permeability, remain elusive because mathematical models that express their relationship to the MR signal accurately are intractable. Here, we propose to use computational models learned from simulations to estimate these parameters. We demonstrate the approach in an example which estimates water residence time in brain white matter. The residence time $\tau$iof water inside axons is a potentially important biomarker for white matter pathologies of the human central nervous system, as myelin damage is hypothesised to affect axonal permeability, and thus $\tau$i. We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning (specifically here a random forest regressor) in order to learn a mapping between features derived from diffusion weighted MR signals and ground truth microstructure parameters, including $\tau$i. We test our numerical model using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that estimated parameters have strong correlations with the ground truth parameters (R2={\{}0.88,0.95,0.82,0.99{\}}) for volume fraction, residence time, axon radius and diffusivity respectively), and provide a marked improvement over the most widely used K{\"{a}}rger model (R2={\{}0.75,0.60,0.11,0.99{\}}). The trained model also estimates sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data acquired from healthy controls, matching values found in literature, and provides better reproducibility than the K{\"{a}}rger model on both the voxel and ROI level. Finally, we acquire data from two Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and compare to the values in healthy subjects. We find that in the splenium of corpus callosum (CC-S) the estimate of the residence time is 0.57±0.05 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CC-S it is 0.33±0.12 s in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and 0.19±0.11 s in the lesion. In the corticospinal tracts (CST) the estimate of the residence time is 0.52±0.09 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CST it is 0.56±0.05 s in the NAWM and 0.13±0.09 s in the lesion. These results agree with our expectations that the residence time in lesions would be lower than in NAWM because the loss of myelin should increase permeability. Overall, we find parameter estimates in the two MS patients consistent with expectations from the pathology of MS lesions demonstrating the clinical potential of this new technique.},

Here, we use Monte-Carlo simulations of many particles diffusing in cylindrical compartments with secondary structures mimicking spines and leaflets of neuronal and glial cell fibers, to investigate to what extent the diffusion-weighted signal of intracellular molecules is sensitive to spines/leaflets density and length. In order to study the specificity of DW-MR signal to these kinds of secondary structures, beading-like geometry is simulated as “control” deviation from smooth cylinder too. Results suggest that: a) the estimated intracellular tortuosity increases as spines/leaflets density or length (beading amplitude) increase; b) the tortuosity limit is reached for diffusion time td{\textgreater}200 ms for metabolites and td{\textgreater}70 ms for water molecules, suggesting that the effects of these finer morphological details are negligible at tdlonger than these threshold values; c) fiber diameter is overestimated, while intracellular diffusivity is underestimated, when simple geometrical models based on hollow smooth cylinders are used; d) apparent surface-to-volume, S/V, ratio estimated by linear fit of high frequency OG data appears to be an excellent estimation of the actual S/V ratio, even in the presence of secondary structures, and it increases as spines and leaflets density or length increase (while decreasing as beadings amplitude increases). Comparison between numerical simulations and multimodal metabolites DW-MRS experiments in vivo in mouse brain shows that these fine structures may affect the DW-MRS signal and the derived diffusion metrics consistently with their expected density and geometrical features. This work suggests that finer structures of cell morphology have non-negligible effects on intracellular molecules' diffusion that may be measured by using multimodal DW-MRS approaches, stimulating future developments and applications.},

abstract = {Many closed-form analytical models have been proposed to relate the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) signal to microstructural features of white matter tissues. These models generally make assumptions about the tissue and the diffusion processes which often depart from the biophysical reality, limiting their reliability and interpretability in practice. Monte Carlo simulations of the random walk of water molecules are widely recognized to provide near groundtruth for DW-MRI signals. However, they have mostly been limited to the validation of simpler models rather than used for the estimation of microstructural properties. This work proposes a general framework which leverages Monte Carlo simulations for the estimation of physically interpretable microstructural parameters, both in single and in crossing fascicles of axons. Monte Carlo simulations of DW-MRI signals, or fingerprints, are pre-computed for a large collection of microstructural configurations. At every voxel, the microstructural parameters are estimated by optimizing a sparse combination of these fingerprints. Extensive synthetic experiments showed that our approach achieves accurate and robust estimates in the presence of noise and uncertainties over fixed or input parameters. In an in vivo rat model of spinal cord injury, our approach provided microstructural parameters that showed better correspondence with histology than five closed-form models of the diffusion signal: MMWMD, NODDI, DIAMOND, WMTI and MAPL. On whole-brain in vivo data from the human connectome project (HCP), our method exhibited spatial distributions of apparent axonal radius and axonal density indices in keeping with ex vivo studies. This work paves the way for microstructure fingerprinting with Monte Carlo simulations used directly at the modeling stage and not only as a validation tool.},

abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) is a widely employed numerical technique for approximating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) in various science and engineering applications. Many of these applications benefit from fast execution of the FEM pipeline. One way to accelerate the FEM pipeline is by exploiting advances in modern computational hardware, such as the many-core streaming processors like the graphical processing unit (GPU). In this paper, we present the algorithms and data-structures necessary to move the entire FEM pipeline to the GPU. First we propose an efficient GPU-based algorithm to generate local element information and to assemble the global linear system associated with the FEM discretization of an elliptic PDE. To solve the corresponding linear system efficiently on the GPU, we implement a conjugate gradient method preconditioned with a geometry-informed algebraic multigrid (AMG) method preconditioner. We propose a new fine-grained parallelism strategy, a corresponding multigrid cycling stage and efficient data mapping to the many-core architecture of GPU. Comparison of our on-GPU assembly versus a traditional serial implementation on the CPU achieves up to an 87× speedup. Focusing on the linear system solver alone, we achieve a speedup of up to 51× versus use of a comparable state-of-the-art serial CPU linear system solver. Furthermore, the method compares favorably with other GPU-based, sparse, linear solvers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of the apparent rate of water diffusion in tumors are sensitive to variations in tissue cellularity, which have been shown useful for characterizing tumors and their responses to treatments. However, because of technical limitations on most MRI systems, conventional pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) methods measure relatively long time scales, during which water molecules may encounter diffusion barriers at multiple spatial scales, including those much greater than typical cell dimensions. As such they cannot distinguish changes on subcellular scales from gross changes in cell density. Oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) methods have the potential to distinguish effects on restriction at much shorter time and length scales. Both PGSE and OGSE methods have been studied numerically by simulating diffusion in a three-dimensional, multicompartment tissue model. The results show that conventional measurements with the PGSE method cannot selectively probe variations over short length scales and, therefore, are relatively insensitive to intracellular structure, whereas results using OGSE methods at moderate gradient frequencies are affected by variations in cell nuclear sizes and can distinguish tissues that differ only over subcellular length scales. This additional sensitivity suggests that OGSE imaging may have significant advantages over conventional PGSE methods for characterizing tumors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple biomarkers are used to quantify the severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to predict outcome. Few are satisfactory. CT and conventional MR imaging underestimate injury and correlate poorly with outcome. New MR imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can provide information about brain ultrastructure by quantifying isotropic and anisotropic water diffusion. Our objective was to determine if changes in anisotropic diffusion in TBI correlate with acute Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and/or Rankin scores at discharge.METHODS:Twenty patients (15 male, five Female; mean age, 31 years) were evaluated. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured at multiple locations and correlated with clinical scores. Results were compared with those of 15 healthy control subjects.RESULTS: ADC values were significantly reduced within the splenium ($\Delta$18{\%}, P = .001). FA values were significantly reduced in the internal capsule ($\Delta$14{\%}; P {\textless} .001) and splenium ($\Delta$16{\%}; P = .002). FA values were significantly correlated with GCS (r = 0.65–0.74; P {\textless} .001) and Rankin (r = 0.68–0.71; P {\textless} .001) scores for the internal capsule and splenium. The correlation between FA and clinical markers was better than for the corresponding ADC values. No correlation was found between ADC of the internal capsule and GCS/Rankin scores.CONCLUSION: DTI reveals changes in the white matter that are correlated with both acute GCS and Rankin scores at discharge. DTI may be a valuable biomarker for the severity of tissue injury and a predictor for outcome.},

abstract = {The goal of the current investigation was to detect clinically important axonal damage in cerebral white matter after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, we evaluated a prospective, pilot study of six subjects with isolated mild TBI and six matched orthopedic controls. All subjects underwent DTI scanning, post-concussive symptom (PCS) assessment, and neurobehavioral testing within 72 h of injury. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and trace values in white matter voxels of whole brain and five preselected regions of interest (ROI) were compared in mild TBI and control subjects using a quantile approach. In addition, whole brain images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. All subjects underwent quality of life and repeat PCS assessment at 1 month. Whole brain images revealed significantly lower 1(st) percentile trace values (mean 0.465 vs. 0.488, p = 0.049) among mild TBI subjects. These trace values correlated with PCS scores at both 72 h (r = -0.57, p = 0.05) and 1 month (r = -0.61, p = 0.04). Analysis of ROIs showed mild TBI subjects to have significantly lower mean trace in the left anterior internal capsule (0.536 vs. 0.574, p = 0.007) and higher maximum ROI-specific median FA values (mean 0.801 vs. 0.756, p = 0.035) in the posterior corpus callosum. These FA values correlated with 72-h PCS score (r = -0.63, p = 0.03), and two neurobehavioral tests (visual motor speed [r = 0.63, p = 0.03] and impulse control [r = 0.59, p = 0.04]). Collectively, DTI detected significantly lower trace and elevated FA values in mild TBI subjects compared to controls. These abnormalities correlated to poor clinical outcome. We believe these findings represent axonal swelling, an early step in the process of axonal injury.},

We hypothesized that there were local differences in axonal injury within the corpus callosum as investigated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), varying among patients with differing severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Ten control subjects (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 37 -▌ 9 years) and 39 patients with TBI (27 men, 12 women; 34 -▌ 12 years) were investigated, of whom 24 had mild; 9, moderate; and 6, severe TBI. Regions of interest were selected in the callosal genu, body, and splenium to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the number of fibers passing through. Statistical comparison was made through analysis of variance with the Scheff+¬ post hoc analysis.RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with mild TBI investigated {\textless}3 months posttrauma (n = 12) had reduced FA (P {\textless} .01) and increased ADC (P {\textless} .05) in the genu, whereas patients with mild TBI investigated $\Gamma${\"{e}}{\~{N}}3 months posttrauma (n = 12) showed no significant differences.

Diffusion in the intracellular compartment has been found to be highly restricted, with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(1)) dependent on the experimental parameters. Extracellular diffusion mediated by tortuosity, depends on tissue geometry, but not on the experimental conditions. Both the intra- and extracellular diffusion can be anisotropic and exhibit non-monoexponential behavior. The cell membrane permeability is shown to significantly influence the diffusion measurement in tissues. In consequence, the phenomenological, bi-exponential models of diffusion cannot directly estimate the intrinsic characteristics of intra- and extracellular water. The mechanisms of the ADC decrease after stroke are also discussed.},

Purpose: To assess the validity of the superposition approximation for crossing fascicles, i.e., the assumption that the total diffusion-weighted MRI signal is the sum of the signals arising from each fascicle independently, even when the fascicles intermingle in a voxel. Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the impact of the approximation on the diffusion-weighted MRI signal and to assess whether this approximate model allows microstructural features of interwoven fascicles to be accurately estimated, despite signal differences. Results: Small normalized signal differences were observed, typically 10-3-10-2. The use of the approximation had little impact on the estimation of the crossing angle, the axonal density index, and the radius index in clinically realistic scenarios wherein the acquisition noise was the predominant source of errors. In the absence of noise, large systematic errors due to the superposition approximation only persisted for the radius index, mainly driven by a low sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI signals to small radii in general. Conclusion: The use of the superposition approximation rather than a model of interwoven fascicles does not adversely impact the estimation of microstructural features of interwoven fascicles in most current clinical settings.},

abstract = {A geometrical confinement considerably affects the diffusive motion of the nuclei and the consequent signal attenuation under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In this article, we illustrate the use of Laplacian eigenfunctions to describe this effect. Starting from the classical Bloch-Torrey equation, we obtain the free induction decay (FID) and the spin-echo or gradient-echo signal in a compact matrix form. Each attenua- tion mechanism (restricted diffusion, gradient dephasing, surface or bulk relaxation) is represented by a matrix which is constructed from the Laplace operator eigenbasis and thus depending only on the geometry of the confinement. In turn, the physical parame- ters (free diffusion coefficient, gradient intensity, surface or bulk relaxivity) characterize the ‘‘strengths'' of the underlying attenuation mechanisms and naturally appear as coeffi- cients in front of these matrices. Once the Laplacian eigenfunctions for a given confine- ment are found (analytically or numerically), further computation of the macroscopic sig- nal is more accurate and much faster than by using conventional simulation methods. The matrix technique is actually a simple numerical tool to deal with arbitrary gradient waveforms, including simple or stimulated, single or multiple spin echoes. We illustrate its efficiency by considering restricted diffusion in simple domains: a slab, a cylinder, and a sphere. In a companion paper, we shall focus on theoretical advances achieved by using Laplacian eigenfunctions},

We obtained a 20-80{\%} rise time (tr) of approximately 80 micros at 22 degrees C, shorter than any previously reported values, and tr variability (SD) with an upper limit of 25-30 micros. Extracellular electrode pressure can increase tr and its variability by 2- to 3-fold. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled passive acetylcholine diffusion through a vesicle fusion pore expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(-1) (rapid, from endplate omega figure appearance) or 0.275 nm x ms(-1) (slow, from mast cell exocytosis). Simulated mEPCs obtained with rapid expansion reproduced tr and the overall shape of our experimental mEPCs, and were similar to simulated mEPCs obtained with instant acetylcholine release. We conclude that passive transmitter diffusion, coupled with rapid expansion of the fusion pore, is sufficient to explain the time course of experimentally measured synaptic currents with trs of less than 100 micros.},

abstract = {Diffusion of molecules in brain and other tissues is important in a wide range of biological processes and measurements ranging from the delivery of drugs to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging is a powerful noninvasive method to characterize neuronal tissue in the human brain in vivo. As a first step toward understanding the relationship between the measured macroscopic apparent diffusion tensor and underlying microscopic compartmental geometry and physical properties, we treat a white matter fascicle as an array of identical thick-walled cylindrical tubes arranged periodically in a regular lattice and immersed in an outer medium. Both square and hexagonal arrays are considered. The diffusing molecules may have different diffusion coefficients and concentrations (or densities) in different domains, namely within the tubes' inner core, membrane, myelin sheath, and within the outer medium. Analytical results are used to explore the effects of a large range of microstructural and compositional parameters on the apparent diffusion tensor and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, allowing the characterization of diffusion in normal physiological conditions as well as changes occurring in development, disease, and aging. Implications for diffusion tensor imaging and for the possible in situ estimation of microstructural parameters from diffusion-weighted MR data are discussed in the context of this modeling framework. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Ginsburger, Poupon, Beaujoin, Estournet, Matuschke, Mangin, Axer and Poupon. White matter is composed of irregularly packed axons leading to a structural disorder in the extra-axonal space. Diffusion MRI experiments using oscillating gradient spin echo sequences have shown that the diffusivity transverse to axons in this extra-axonal space is dependent on the frequency of the employed sequence. In this study, we observe the same frequency-dependence using 3D simulations of the diffusion process in disordered media. We design a novel white matter numerical phantom generation algorithm which constructs biomimicking geometric configurations with few design parameters, and enables to control the level of disorder of the generated phantoms. The influence of various geometrical parameters present in white matter, such as global angular dispersion, tortuosity, presence of Ranvier nodes, beading, on the extra-cellular perpendicular diffusivity frequency dependence was investigated by simulating the diffusion process in numerical phantoms of increasing complexity and fitting the resulting simulated diffusion MR signal attenuation with an adequate analytical model designed for trapezoidal OGSE sequences.This work suggests that angular dispersion and especially beading have non-negligible effects on this extracellular diffusion metrics that may be measured using standard OGSE DW-MRI clinical protocols.},

abstract = {Direct measurement of tissue microstructure with diffusion MRI offers a new class of markers, such as axon diameters, that give more specific information about tissue than measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging. The existing techniques of this kind assume a single axon orientation in the tissue model, which may be a reasonable approximation only for the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as the corpus callosum. For most other areas, orientation dispersion is not negligible and, if unaccounted for, leads to overestimation of the axon diameters, prohibiting their accurate mapping over the whole brain. Here we propose a new model that captures the effect of orientation dispersion explicitly. A numerical scheme is developed to compute the diffusion signal prescribed by the proposed model efficiently, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the axon diameter and orientation dispersion. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that the new model provides an axon diameter index that is robust to the presence of orientation dispersion. Results on in vivo human data show reduced axon diameter index and better agreement with histology compared to previous methods suggesting improvements in the axon diameter estimate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30. min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10. min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {While myelinated axons present an important barrier to water diffusion, many models used to interpret DWI signal neglect other potential influences of myelin. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were used to test the sensitivity of DWI results to the diffusive properties of water within myelin. Within these simulations, the apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app) varied slowly over several orders of magnitude of the coefficient of myelin water diffusion (D-m), but exhibited important differences compared to D-app values simulated that neglect D-m (= 0). Compared to D-app, the apparent diffusion kurtosis (K-app) was generally more sensitive to D-m. Simulations also tested the sensitivity of D-app and K-app to the amount of myelin present. Unique variations in D-app and K-app caused by differences in the myelin volume fraction were diminished when myelin water diffusion was included. Also, expected trends in Dapp and Kapp with experimental echo time were reduced or inverted when accounting for myelin water diffusion, and these reduced/inverted trends were seen experimentally in ex vivo rat brain DWI experiments. In general, myelin water has the potential to subtly influence DWI results and bias models of DWI that neglect these components of white matter.},

abstract = {Numerical analysis presents different faces to the world. For mathematicians it is a bona fide mathematical theory with an applicable flavour. For scientists and engineers it is a practical, applied subject, part of the standard repertoire of modelling techniques. For computer scientists it is a theory on the interplay of computer architecture and algorithms for real-number calculations. The tension between these standpoints is the driving force of this book, which presents a rigorous account of the fundamentals of numerical analysis of both ordinary and partial differential equations. The point of departure is mathematical but the exposition strives to maintain a balance between theoretical, algorithmic and applied aspects of the subject. In detail, topics covered include numerical solution of ordinary differential equations by multistep and Runge-Kutta methods; finite difference and finite elements techniques for the Poisson equation; a variety of algorithms to solve large, sparse algebraic systems; methods for parabolic and hyperbolic differential equations and techniques of their analysis. The book is accompanied by an appendix that presents brief back-up in a number of mathematical topics. Dr Iserles concentrates on fundamentals: deriving methods from first principles, analysing them with a variety of mathematical techniques and occasionally discussing questions of implementation and applications. By doing so, he is able to lead the reader to theoretical understanding of the subject without neglecting its practical aspects. The outcome is a textbook that is mathematically honest and rigorous and provides its target audience with a wide range of skills in both ordinary and partial differential equations.},

The accuracy of the Gaussian phase-distribution (GPD) approximation and the short-gradient-pulse (SGP) limit for spins confined to spheres and between planes has been investigated.

abstract = {While functional brain imaging methods can locate the cortical regions subserving particular cognitive functions, the connectivity between the functional areas of the human brain remains poorly understood. Recently, investigators have proposed a method to image neural connectivity noninvasively using a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI measures the molecular diffusion of water along neural pathways. Accurate reconstruction of neural connectivity patterns from DTI has been hindered, however, by the inability of DTI to resolve more than a single axon direction within each imaging voxel. Here, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that can resolve multiple axon directions within a single voxel. The technique, called q-ball imaging, can resolve intravoxel white matter fiber crossing as well as white matter insertions into cortex. The ability of q-ball imaging to resolve complex intravoxel fiber architecture eliminates a key obstacle to mapping neural connectivity in the human brain noninvasively.},

abstract = {This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the optimal value of the diffusion weighting factor b for estimating white-matter fiber orientations using diffusion MRI with a standard spherical sampling scheme. We devise an algorithm for determining the optimal echo time, pulse width, and pulse separation in the pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence for a specific value of b. The Monte Carlo simulations provide an estimate of the optimal value of b for recovering one and two fiber orientations. We show that the optimum is largely independent of the noise level in the measurements and the number of gradient directions and that the optimum depends only weakly on the diffusion anisotropy, the maximum gradient strength, and the spin-spin relaxation time. The optimum depends strongly on the mean diffusivity. In brain tissue, the optima we estimate are in the ranges [0.7, 1.0] × 109s m-2and [2.2, 2.8] × 109s m-2for the one- and two-fiber cases, respectively. The best b for estimating the fractional anisotropy is slightly higher than for estimating fiber directions in the one-fiber case and slightly lower in the two-fiber case. To estimate Tr(D) in the one-fiber case, the optimal setting is higher still. Simulations suggest that a ratio of high to low b measurements of 5 to 1 is a good compromise for measuring fiber directions and size and shape indices. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging is best known for its spectacular use in medical tomography. However the method has potential applications in biology, materials science, and chemical physics, some of which have begun to be realized as laboratory NRM spectrometers have been adapted to enable small scale imaging. NMR microscopy has available a rich variety of contrast including molecular specificity and sensitivity to molecular dynamics. In NMR imaging the signal is acquired in k-space, a dimension which bears a Fourier relationship with the positions of nuclear spins. A dynamic analogue of k-space imaging is the Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) experiment in which the signal is acquired in q-space, conjugate to the distances moved by the spins over a well-defined time interval. q-space microscopy provides images of the nuclear self-correlation function with a resolution some two orders of magnitude better than is possible in imaging the nuclear density. As well as revealing the spectrum of molecular motion, PGSE NMR can be used to study morphology in porous systems through the influence of motional boundaries. This book explores principles and common themes underlying these two variants of NMR Microscopy, providing many examples of their use. The methods discussed here are of importance in fundamental biological and physical research, as well as having applications in a wide variety of industries, including those concerned with petrochemicals, polymers, biotechnology, food processing and natural product processing.},

The distribution of phase shifts is shown to be Gaussian in the limits when the time between pulses is either long or short compared to the time required for a spin to diffuse from one boundary to another. The distribution is assumed to be Gaussian in the intermediate case, and the problem is reduced to the calculation of the mean square phase change due to diffusion. Expressions for spin echo amplitudes are derived for the cases of planar, spherical, and cylindrical boundaries, and forms are derived that are valid when the time of the measurement is very long or very short compared with the time required for diffusion between boundaries.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI has been proposed as a non-invasive technique for axonal diameter mapping. However, accurate estimation of small diameters requires strong gradients, which is a challenge for the transition of the technique from preclinical to clinical MRI scanners, since these have weaker gradients. In this work, we develop a framework to estimate the lower bound for accurate diameter estimation, which we refer to as the resolution limit. We analyse only the contribution from the intra-axonal space and assume that axons can be represented by impermeable cylinders. To address the growing interest in using techniques for diffusion encoding that go beyond the conventional single diffusion encoding (SDE) sequence, we present a generalised analysis capable of predicting the resolution limit regardless of the gradient waveform. Using this framework, waveforms were optimised to minimise the resolution limit. The results show that, for parallel cylinders, the SDE experiment is optimal in terms of yielding the lowest possible resolution limit. In the presence of orientation dispersion, diffusion encoding sequences with square-wave oscillating gradients were optimal. The resolution limit for standard clinical MRI scanners (maximum gradient strength 60-80 mT/m) was found to be between 4 and 8 mum, depending on the noise levels and the level of orientation dispersion. For scanners with a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m, the limit was reduced to between 2 and 5 mum.},

Quite a basic implementation as it stands I think. At least the examples that are shown and available with the code are quite simple.

Rather than reflecting at boundaries they seem to only take a step if it will not cross a boundary to prevent branching and looping within the GPU kernel.

Their implementation has this rejection sampling approach which basically means that new geometries are implemented by changing the rejection regions, but I think this will be difficult to generalise to complex geometries and for including things like permeability.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of the current study was to investigate tissue pathology at the cellular level in traumatic brain injury (TBI) as revealed by Monte Carlo simulation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived parameters and elucidate the possible sources of conflicting findings of DTI abnormalities as reported in the TBI literature. METHODS: A model with three compartments separated by permeable membranes was employed to represent the diffusion environment of water molecules in brain white matter. The dynamic diffusion process was simulated with a Monte Carlo method using adjustable parameters of intra-axonal diffusivity, axon separation, glial cell volume fraction, and myelin sheath permeability. The effects of tissue pathology on DTI parameters were investigated by adjusting the parameters of the model corresponding to different stages of brain injury. RESULTS: The results suggest that the model is appropriate and the DTI-derived parameters simulate the predominant cellular pathology after TBI. Our results further indicate that when edema is not prevalent, axial and radial diffusivity have better sensitivity to axonal injury and demyelination than other DTI parameters. CONCLUSION: DTI is a promising biomarker to detect and stage tissue injury after TBI. The observed inconsistencies among previous studies are likely due to scanning at different stages of tissue injury after TBI.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. Purpose: Water exchange exists between different neuronal compartments of brain tissue but is often ignored in most diffusion models. The goal of the current study was to demonstrate the dependence of diffusion measurements on echo time (TE) in the human brain and to investigate the underlying effects of myelin water exchange. Methods: Five healthy subjects were examined with single-shot pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar imaging with fixed duration ($\delta$) and separation ($\Delta$) of diffusion gradient pulses and a set of varying TEs. The effects of water exchange and intrinsic T 2 difference in cellular environments were investigated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Both in vivo measurements and simulations showed that fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) had positive correlations with TE, while radial diffusivity (RD) showed a negative correlation, which is consistent with a previous study. The simulation results further indicated the sensitivity of TE dependence to the change of g-ratio. Conclusion: The exchange between myelin and intra/extra-axonal water pools often plays a non-negligible role in the observed TE dependence of diffusion parameters, which may accompany or alter the effect of intrinsic T 2 in causing such dependence. The TE dependence may potentially serve as a biomarker for demyelination processes (e.g., in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease).},

The resulting coherence patterns appear in plots of the normalized PGSE signal intensities as a function of the spatial wave vector Q in a so-called q-space plot. The origin of these phenomena and their mathematical and physical underpinnings are now well established. We have conducted a number of studies of diffusion-coherence phenomena in suspensions of red blood cells and have made extensive use of computer simulations of molecular diffusion in virtual lattices of cells to aid in the interpretation and analysis of experimental data. In the current work we extended the canonical model used in these studies to investigate the effect that varying the packing arrangement of cells in the suspension has on the coherence patterns, as seen in q-space plots. We show that changes in the packing arrangement of cells are reflected in the q-space plots and in the results of diffusion tensor analysis and thus we speculate upon the possible clinical importance of these findings.},

abstract = {Specific parameters of the neuronal tissue microstructure, such as axonal diameters, membrane permeability and intracellular water fractions are assessable using diffusion MRI. These parameters are commonly estimated using analytical models, which may introduce bias in the estimated parameters due to the approximations made when deriving the models. As an alternative to using analytical models, a database of signal curves generated by fast Monte Carlo simulations can be employed. Simulated diffusion MRI measurements were generated and evaluated using the two-compartment K??rger model as well as the simulation model based on a database containing signal curves from approximately 60 000 simulations performed with different combinations of microstructural parameters. A protocol based on a pulsed gradient spin echo sequence with diffusion times of 30 and 60 ms and with gradient amplitudes obtainable with a clinical MRI scanner was employed for the investigations. When using the analytical model, a major negative bias (up to approximately 25{\%}) in the estimated intracellular volume fraction was observed for short exchange times, while almost no bias was seen for the simulation model.

abstract = {Many axons follow wave-like undulating courses. This is a general feature of extracranial nerve segments, but is also found in some intracranial nervous tissue. The importance of axonal undulation has previously been considered, for example, in the context of biomechanics, where it has been shown that posture affects undulation properties. However, the importance of axonal undulation in the context of diffusion MR measurements has not been investigated. Using an analytical model and Monte Carlo simulations of water diffusion, this study compared undulating and straight axons in terms of diffusion propagators, diffusion-weighted signal intensities and parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging, such as the mean diffusivity (MD), the eigenvalues and the fractional anisotropy (FA). All parameters were strongly affected by the presence of undulation. The diffusivity perpendicular to the undulating axons increased with the undulation amplitude, thus resembling that of straight axons with larger diameters. Consequently, models assuming straight axons for the estimation of the axon diameter from diffusion MR measurements might overestimate the diameter if undulation is present. FA decreased from approximately 0.7 to 0.5 when axonal undulation was introduced into the simulation model structure. Our results indicate that axonal undulation may play a role in diffusion measurements when investigating, for example, the optic and sciatic nerves and the spinal cord. The simulations also demonstrate that the stretching or compression of neuronal tissue comprising undulating axons alters the observed water diffusivity, suggesting that posture may be of importance for the outcome of diffusion MRI measurements.},

abstract = {Interpreting brain diffusion MRI measurements in terms of neuronal structure at a micrometer level is an exciting unresolved problem. Here we consider diffusion transverse to a bundle of fibers, and show theoretically, as well as using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements in a phantom made of parallel fibers mimicking axons, that the time dependent diffusion coefficient approaches its macroscopic limit slowly, in a (ln t)/. t fashion. The logarithmic singularity arises due to short range disorder in the fiber packing. We identify short range disorder in axonal fibers based on histological data from the splenium, and argue that the time dependent contribution to the overall diffusion coefficient from the extra-axonal water dominates that of the intra-axonal water. This dominance may explain the bias in measuring axon diameters in clinical settings. The short range disorder is also reflected in the asymptotically linear frequency dependence of the diffusion coefficient measured with oscillating gradients, in agreement with recent experiments. Our results relate the measured diffusion to the mesoscopic structure of neuronal tissue, uncovering the sensitivity of diffusion metrics to axonal arrangement within a fiber tract, and providing an alternative interpretation of axonal diameter mapping techniques.},

abstract = {This article concerns the question of a proper stochastic treatment of the spin-echo self-diffusion attenuation of confined particles that arises when short gradient pulse approximation fails. Diffusion is numerically simulated as a succession of random steps when motion is restricted between two perfectly reflecting parallel planes. With the magnetic field gradient perpendicular to the plane boundaries, the spatial distribution of the spin-echo signal is calculated from the simulated trajectories. The diffusion propagator approach (Callaghan, "Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy," Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 1991), which is just the same as the evaluation of the spin-echo attenuation by the method of cumulant expansion in the Gaussian approximation, with Einstein's approximation of the velocity correlation function (VCF) (delta function), agrees with the results of simulation only for the particle displacements that are much smaller than the size of the confinement. A strong deviation from the results of the simulation appears when the bouncing rate from the boundaries increases at intermediate and long gradient sequences. A better fit, at least for intermediate particle displacements, was obtained by replacing the VCF with the Oppenheim-Mazur solution of the Langevin equation (Oppenheim and Mazur, Physica 30, 1833-1845, 1964), which is modified in a way to allow for spatial dependence of particle displacements. Clearly, interplay of the correlation dynamics and the boundary conditions is taking place for large diffusion displacements. However, the deviation at long times demonstrates a deficiency of the Gaussian approximation for the spin echo of diffusion inside entirely closed pores. Here, the cumulants higher than the second one might not be negligible. The results are compared with the experiments on the edge enhancement by magnetic resonance imaging of a pore. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and tests a technique for imaging orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density in white matter using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3. T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware. This demonstration motivates further refinement, validation, and evaluation of the precise nature of the indices and the influence of potential confounds. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The pulsed field gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance method is used to measure the translational diffusion of solvents and solutes in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. It is widely used in the characterization of molecules and materials in general, via phenomena such as ‘diffusion interference'. It is also the basis of tissue discrimination in magnetic resonance imaging, via diffusion tensor imaging. The mathematical equation used to analyze data from a simple noninteracting solute (using a pair of magnetic field gradient pulses that are applied in the experiment) was first derived by Stejskal and Tanner. However, in the article and in subsequent presentations the basic derivation, which we call the the ‘‘theoretical physics'' of the theory, is not pre- sented in extenso. Conversely, many papers in which the exploration of the effects of mag- netic field gradient pulses of shapes other than simple rectangles generally begin with the time-dependent integral that emerges from the original theoretical physics. To fill this ‘‘pedagogical gap'' we use here a rigorous step-by-step approach to the theoretical physics of the Stejskal–Tanner equation and indicate how it was based on earlier theories. We also take the opportunity to indicate a contemporary approach to deriving new relationships between user-defined magnetic field gradient pulse shapes and the diffusion coefficient; and we show how these can be rapidly and accurately derived using symbolic computation.},

abstract = {A derivation is given of the effect of a time‐dependent magnetic field gradient on the spin‐echo experiment, particularly in the presence of spin diffusion. There are several reasons for preferring certain kinds of time‐dependent magnetic field gradients to the more usual steady gradient. If the gradient is reduced during the rf pulses, H1 need not be particularly large; if the gradient is small at the time of the echo, the echo will be broad and its amplitude easy to measure. Both of these relaxations of restrictions on the measurement of diffusion coefficients by the spin‐echo technique serve to extend its range of applicability. Furthermore, a pulsed gradient can be recommended when it is critical to define the precise time period over which diffusion is being measured.The theoretical expression derived has been verified experimentally for several choices of time dependent magnetic field gradient. An apparatus is described suitable for the production of pulsed gradients with amplitudes as large as 100 G cm−1. The diffusion coefficient of dry glycerol at 26°±1°C has been found to be (2.5±0.2)×10−8 cm2 sec−1, a value smaller than can ordinarily be measured by the steady gradient method.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In the brain, there is growing interest in using the temporal diffusion spectrum to characterize axonal geometry in white matter because of the potential to be more sensitive to small pores compared to conventional time-dependent diffusion. However, analytical expressions for the diffusion spectrum of particles have only been derived for simple, restricting geometries such as cylinders, which are often used as a model for intra-axonal diffusion. The extra-axonal space is more complex, but the diffusion spectrum has largely not been modeled. We propose a model for the extra-axonal space, which can be used for interpretation of experimental data. THEORY AND METHODS: An empirical model describing the extra-axonal space diffusion spectrum was compared with simulated spectra. Spectra were simulated using Monte Carlo methods for idealized, regularly and randomly packed axons over a wide range of packing densities and spatial scales. The model parameters are related to the microstructural properties of tortuosity, axonal radius, and separation for regularly packed axons and pore size for randomly packed axons. RESULTS: Forward model predictions closely matched simulations. The model fitted the simulated spectra well and accurately estimated microstructural properties. CONCLUSIONS: This simple model provides expressions that relate the diffusion spectrum to biologically relevant microstructural properties.

abstract = {Axonal density and diameter are two fundamental properties of brain white matter. Recently, advanced diffusion MRI techniques have made these two parameters accessible in vivo. However, the techniques available to estimate such parameters are still under development. For example, current methods to map axonal diameters capture relative trends over different structures, but consistently over-estimate absolute diameters. Axonal density estimates are more accessible experimentally, but different modeling approaches exist and the impact of the experimental parameters has not been thoroughly quantified, potentially leading to incompatibility of results obtained in different studies using different techniques. Here, we characterise the impact of diffusion time on axonal density and diameter estimates using Monte Carlo simulations and STEAM diffusion MRI at 7 T on 9 healthy volunteers. We show that axonal density and diameter estimates strongly depend on diffusion time, with diameters almost invariably overestimated and density both over and underestimated for some commonly used models. Crucially, we also demonstrate that these biases are reduced when the model accounts for diffusion time dependency in the extra-axonal space. For axonal density estimates, both upward and downward bias in different situations are removed by modeling extra-axonal time-dependence, showing increased accuracy in these estimates. For axonal diameter estimates, we report increased accuracy in ground truth simulations and axonal diameter estimates decreased away from high values given by earlier models and towards known values in the human corpus callosum when modeling extra-axonal time-dependence. Axonal diameter feasibility under both advanced and clinical settings is discussed in the light of the proposed advances.},

For the quantitative evaluation of several fiber-tracking properties, such as accuracy, noise sensitivity, and robustness, synthetic ground-truth DT-MRI data are required. Moreover, an accurate simulated phantom is also required for optimization of the user-defined tractography parameters, and objective comparisons between fiber-tracking algorithms. Therefore, in this study a mathematical framework for simulating DT-MRI data, based on the physical properties of WM fiber bundles, is presented. We obtained a model of a WM fiber bundle by parameterizing the various features that characterize this bundle. We then evaluated three different synthetic DT-MRI models using experimental data in order to test the proposed methodology, and to determine the optimum model and parameter settings for constructing a realistic simulated DT-MRI phantom. Several examples of how the mathematical framework can be applied to compare fiber-tracking algorithms are presented.},

However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the DW-MR images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
annote = {This paper looks to generate tracts for simulating tractography. 

They produce these balls of axons by randomly sampling two points on the surface of a sphere and connecting them. Then they update them to bend around one another and then split the big tracts into smaller ones and iterate the bending thing. 

The strands themselves are modelled basiclaly as a spine defined between points with a constant radius of the strand along the spine. 

It seems as though they don't actually force strands not ot intersect. It seems to me as though they penalise overlap in the optimisation but don't explicitily prevent it. 

With the bundles, they subdivide the space into voxels so that each voxel is associated with a single tract and then the signals are simulated from a tensor based off of the signal at that point.},

abstract = {Simulations of diffusion in neural tissues have traditionally been limited to analytical solutions, to grid-based solvers, or to small-scale Monte Carlo simulations. None of these approaches has had the capability to simulate realistic complex neural tissues on the scale of even a single voxel of reasonable (i.e., clinical) size. An approach is described that combines a Monte Carlo Brownian dynamics simulator capable of simulating diffusion in arbitrarily complex polygonal geometries with a signal integrator flexible enough to handle a variety of pulse sequences. Taken together, this package provides a complete and general simulation environment for diffusion MRI experiments. The simulator is validated against analytical solutions for unbounded diffusion and diffusion between parallel plates. Further results are shown for aligned fibers, varying packing density and permeability, and for crossing straight fibers.},
annote = {Another MC simulation technique. Here they embed MCell, an established simulator of cellular microphysiology within an MRI simulator. 
The MRI simulator tracks the position, state, signal amplitude and phase throughout the simulations. 

Here, unlike Camino, the step length changes from step to step which they say allows them to reduce the number of timesteps needed in the gradient block. Additionally, they store a look-up table of radial directions rather than generating one each time.

MCell allows the diffusion coefficient to be updated when the particle diffuses through a boundary, allowing them to create models with different diffusion coefficient in intra and extra axonal spaces. 

They just compare the results of their simulations to known results.

Second Monte Carlo study I found. Here they simulate spinal cord white matter as permeable cylinders.

The idea is that they can measure the ADC parallel and perpendicular to fibres to see whether there's damange to the fibres. 

Cylinders are simulated on square and hexagonal lattices. 

Simulations are very similar to Szafer et. al 1995 but has two differences - T2 is ignored and rather than reflecting a particle, it is just left where it is. This is to prevent the need to track multiple reflections.

Similar systems in the literature consider only simple substrates and their authors do not consider convergence and parameter optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo simulations within complex irregular substrates. We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess precision and accuracy of the generated results. We obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

Tissue is regarded as a periodic array of boxes surrounded by partially permeable membranes (cells), embedded in an extracellular medium. intracellular and extracellular diffusion coefficients may differ.

Calculated ADCs disagree with values obtained from the widely used "fast exchange" formula. Effects of differences between intracellular and extracellular T2 relaxation times on measured values of ADC and T2 are discussed. The general analysis is specifically applied to the changes occurring in ADC following ischemic insults to brain tissue.

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is known to have a limited capability of resolving multiple fiber orientations within one voxel. This is mainly because the probability density function (PDF) for random spin displacement is non-Gaussian in the confining environment of biological tissues and, thus, the modeling of self-diffusion by a second-order tensor breaks down. The statistical property of a non-Gaussian diffusion process is characterized via the higher-order tensor (HOT) coefficients by reconstructing the PDF of the random spin displacement. Those HOT coefficients can be determined by combining a series of complex diffusion-weighted measurements. The signal equation for an MR diffusion experiment was investigated theoretically by generalizing Fick's law to a higher-order partial differential equation (PDE) obtained via Kramers-Moyal expansion. A relationship has been derived between the HOT coefficients of the PDE and the higher-order cumulants of the random spin displacement. Monte-Carlo simulations of diffusion in a restricted environment with different geometrical shapes were performed, and the strengths and weaknesses of both HOT and established diffusion analysis techniques were investigated. The generalized diffusion tensor formalism is capable of accurately resolving the underlying spin displacement for complex geometrical structures, of which neither conventional DTI nor diffusion-weighted imaging at high angular resolution (HARD) is capable. The HOT method helps illuminate some of the restrictions that are characteristic of these other methods. Furthermore, a direct relationship between HOT and q-space is also established.},

Exchange between compartments is defined so as to depend on the diffusion coefficients and the compartment sizes. Based on the model, it is proposed that an additive "baseline tensor" that correlates with intraaxonal water volume be included in the computation. Anisotropy and tortuosity calculated from such analysis may correspond better to tract ultrastructure than if calculated without the baseline.

The diffusion coefficients as well as the modelled diffusional kurtosis K(fit) were obtained from the signal decay curve, while the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the diffusional kurtosis K were obtained from the displacement distribution. Simulations of restricted diffusion, under conditions similar to those obtainable with a clinical MRI scanner, were carried out assuming various degrees of violation of the short gradient pulse (SGP) condition and of the long diffusion time limit. The results indicated that an MRI system can not be used for quantification of structural sizes less than about 10 microm by means of FWHM since the parameter underestimates the confinements due to violation of the SGP condition. However, FWHM can still be used as an important contrast parameter.

A biexponential model and a two-compartment model including exchange according to the K{\"{a}}rger formalism were employed to analyze the signal-vs.-b curves. To validate the two-compartment model, restricted diffusion with exchange was simulated for uniformly sized cylinders, using different diameters and exchange times.

The in vivo measurements performed perpendicular to the tracts, using b values up to 28000 s/mm2and TDvalues between 64 and 256 ms, did not show the effects of restricted diffusion as expected from previous ex vivo studies. The applied two-compartment model yielded an average axonal diameter of about 4 $\mu$m and an intracellular exchange time of about 300 ms, but did not fit statistically well to the data.

Our framework is quantitative, does not require specialized hardware, is easily implemented with little programming experience, and is freely available as open-source software. Models may include compartments with different diffusivities, permeabilities, and T2 time constants using both parametric (e.g. spheres and cylinders) and arbitrary (e.g. mesh-based) geometries.

abstract = {Water diffusion in neurological tissues is known to possess multicomponent diffusion behavior. The fractions of fast and slow apparent diffusion components have often been attributed to the volume fractions of extracellular space (ECS) and intracellular space (ICS) although diffusion fractions are at variance with the tissue compartment volume ratios. In this article this puzzle was examined with a finite difference diffusion simulation model on the basis of optical images from sectioned rat spinal cord. Here the results show that assignment of fractions obtained from biexponential fits of fast and slow diffusion attenuation to ECS and ICS volume ratios is not correct. Rather, the observed multicomponent diffusion behavior is caused by motional restriction and limited intercompartmental water exchange in that at long diffusion times diffusion attenuation is shown to become monoexponential. Although the measured apparent diffusion fractions also depend on T2 relaxation time of water protons in the various compartments, the sensitivity to T2 is small and thus T2 differences are unlikely to explain the mismatch between apparent diffusion fractions and cellular volume fractions.},

abstract = {This article describes the development and application of an integrated, generalized, and efficient Monte Carlo simulation system for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), named Diffusion Microscopist Simulator (DMS). DMS comprises a random walk Monte Carlo simulator and an MR image synthesizer. The former has the capacity to perform large-scale simulations of Brownian dynamics in the virtual environments of neural tissues at various levels of complexity, and the latter is flexible enough to synthesize dMRI datasets from a variety of simulated MRI pulse sequences. The aims of DMS are to give insights into the link between the fundamental diffusion process in biological tissues and the features observed in dMRI, as well as to provide appropriate ground-truth information for the development, optimization, and validation of dMRI acquisition schemes for different applications. The validity, efficiency, and potential applications of DMS are evaluated through four benchmark experiments, including the simulated dMRI of white matter fibers, the multiple scattering diffusion imaging, the biophysical modeling of polar cell membranes, and the high angular resolution diffusion imaging and fiber tractography of complex fiber configurations. We expect that this novel software tool would be substantially advantageous to clarify the interrelationship between dMRI and the microscopic characteristics of brain tissues, and to advance the biophysical modeling and the dMRI methodologies.},
annote = {The most modern release of an MC simulation code I've found. Though as far as I'm aware, the code has not been released.

Generally just does everything the same as every other MC simulation code.

Second Monte Carlo study I found. Here they simulate spinal cord white matter as permeable cylinders.

The idea is that they can measure the ADC parallel and perpendicular to fibres to see whether there's damange to the fibres. 

Cylinders are simulated on square and hexagonal lattices. 

Simulations are very similar to Szafer et. al 1995 but has two differences - T2 is ignored and rather than reflecting a particle, it is just left where it is. This is to prevent the need to track multiple reflections. 

Use a finite length gradient pulse.

abstract = {Water diffusion in tissues is generally restricted and often anisotropic. Neural tissue is of particular interest, since it is well known that injury alters diffusion in a characteristic manner. Both Monte Carlo simulations and approximate analytical models have previously been reported in attempts to predict water diffusion behavior in the central nervous system. These methods have relied on axonal models, which assume simple geometries (e.g., ellipsoids, cylinders, and square prisms) and ignore the thickness of the myelin sheath. The current work describes a method for generating models using synthetic images. The computations are based on a 3D finite difference (FD) approximation of the diffusion equation. The method was validated with known analytic solutions for diffusion in a cylindrical pore and in a hexagonal array of cylinders. Therefore, it is envisioned that, by exploiting histologic images of neuronal tissues as input model, current method allows investigating the water diffusion behavior inside biological tissues and potentially assessing the status of neural injury and regeneration.},

abstract = {The complex transverse water proton magnetization subject to diffusion-encoding magnetic field gradient pulses in a heterogeneous medium can be modeled by the multiple compartment Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation (PDE). In addition, steady-state Laplace PDEs can be formulated to produce the homogenized diffusion tensor that describes the diffusion characteristics of the medium in the long time limit. In spatial domains that model biological tissues at the cellular level, these two types of PDEs have to be completed with permeability conditions on the cellular interfaces. To solve these PDEs, we implemented a finite elements method that allows jumps in the solution at the cell interfaces by using double nodes. Using a transformation of the Bloch-Torrey PDE we reduced oscillations in the searched-for solution and simplified the implementation of the boundary conditions. The spatial discretization was then coupled to the adaptive explicit Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev time-stepping method. Our proposed method is second order accurate in space and second order accurate in time. We implemented this method on the FEniCS C++ platform and show time and spatial convergence results. Finally, this method is applied to study some relevant questions in diffusion MRI. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structural information on many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light-microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3D tissue structure needs to be reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements can be obtained by automated block-face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy-metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low-vacuum (20-60 Pa H2O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50-70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron-microscope-level 3D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuits.

abstract = {One of the major challenges of modern neuroscience is to define the complex pattern of neural connections that underlie cognition and behaviour. Brain connections have been investigated extensively in many animal species, including monkeys. Until recently, however, we have been unable to verify their existence in humans or identify possible tracts that are unique to the human brain. The Atlas of Human Brain Connections capitalises on novel diffusion MRI tractography methods to provide a comprehensive overview of connections derived from virtual in vivo tractography dissections of the human brain. The book introduces the reader to the fundaments of human brain organization as derived from the study of the surface, sectional and connectional anatomy. It starts with an historical overview of the giant steps taken in neuroanatomy, from its birth more than 2000 years ago, to contemporary neuroimaging insights. Next, detailed descriptions of the major white matter connections, their function, and associated clinical syndromes are dealt with in detail. The composite maps of the atlas are an excellent anatomical resource for teaching, clinical, and research purposes. By reviewing both the basic principles of neuroanatomy, its historical roots, and its modern achievements in the field of DTI tractography, the book aims to fill the gap between the detailed connectional anatomy of the monkey brain and the 19th century descriptions of white matter tracts from post-mortem human dissections. Covering a wide range of topics in the field of clinical neuroanatomy, this book constitutes both an excellent introduction to the brain, as well as a valuable reference work for experienced clinicians and researchers working in the field of neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, and neuroradiology.},

abstract = {An essential step for fibre-tracking is the accurate estimation of neuronal fibre orientations within each imaging voxel, and a number of methods have been proposed to reconstruct the orientation distribution function based on sampling three-dimensional q-space. In the q-space formalism, very short (infinitesimal) gradient pulses are the basic requirement to obtain the true spin displacement probability density function. On current clinical MR systems however, the diffusion gradient pulse duration ($\delta$) is inevitably finite due to the limit on the achievable gradient intensity. The failure to satisfy the short gradient pulse (SGP) requirement has been a recurrent criticism for fibre orientation estimation based on the q-space approach. In this study, the influence of a finite $\Delta$ on the DW signal measured as a function of gradient direction is described theoretically and demonstrated through simulations and experimental models. Our results suggest that the current practice of using long $\Delta$ for DW imaging on human clinical MR scanners, which is enforced by hardware limitations, might in fact be beneficial for estimating fibre orientations. For a given b-value, the prolongation of $\delta$ is advantageous for estimating fibre orientations for two reasons: first, it leads to a boost in DW signal in the transverse plane of the fibre. Second, it stretches out the shape of the measured diffusion profile, which improves the contrast between DW orientations. This is especially beneficial for resolving crossing fibres, as this contrast is essential to discriminate between different fibre directions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

This article provides an overview of diffusion magnetic resonance tractography methods with a focus on how future advances might address challenges in measuring brain connectivity. Parts of this review are somewhat provocative, in the hope that they may trigger discussions possibly lacking in a field where the apparent simplicity of the methods (compared to their functional magnetic resonance imaging counterparts) can hide some fundamental issues that ultimately hinder the interpretation of findings, and cast doubt as to what tractography can really teach us about human brain anatomy. {\textcopyright} 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90{\%} of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups.

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has proven of enormous value in the investigation of porous media. Its use allows to study pore size distributions, tortuosity, and permeability as a function of the relaxation time, diffusivity, and flow. This information plays an important role in plenty of applications, ranging from oil industry to medical diagnosis. A complete NMR analysis involves the solution of the Bloch-Torrey (BT) equation. However, solving this equation analytically becomes intractable for all but the simplest geometries. We present an efficient numerical framework for solving the complete BT equation in arbitrarily complex domains. In addition to the standard BT equation, the generalised BT formulation takes into account the flow and relaxation terms, allowing a better representation of the phenomena under scope. The presented framework is flexible enough to deal parametrically with any order of convergence in the spatial domain. The major advantage of such approach is to allow both faster computations and sensitivity analyses over realistic geometries. Moreover, we developed a second-order implicit scheme for the temporal discretisation with similar computational demands as the existing explicit methods. This represents a huge step forward for obtaining reliable results with few iterations. Comparisons with analytical solutions and real data show the flexibility and accuracy of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Moroney2013,
abstract = {Pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR diffusion measurements provide a powerful technique for probing porous media. The derivation of analytical mathematical models for analysing such experiments is only straightforward for ideal restricting geometries and rapidly becomes intractable as the geometrical complexity increases. Consequently, in general, numerical methods must be employed. Here, a highly flexible method for calculating the results of PGSE NMR experiments in porous systems in the short gradient pulse limit based on the finite element method is presented. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is verified by comparison with the known solutions to simple pore geometries (parallel planes, a cylindrical pore, and a spherical pore) and also to Monte Carlo simulations. The approach is then applied to modelling the more complicated cases of parallel semipermeable planes and a pore hopping model. Finally, the results of a PGSE measurement on a toroidal pore, a geometry for which there is presently no current analytical solution, are presented. This study shows that this approach has great potential for modelling the results of PGSE experiments on real (3D) porous systems. Importantly, the FEM approach provides far greater accuracy in simulating PGSE diffraction data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
