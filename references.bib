abstract = {This paper presents a method for crowd simulation based on a biologically motivated space colonization algorithm. This algorithm was originally introduced to model leaf venation patterns and the branching architecture of trees. It operates by simulating the competition for space between growing veins or branches. Adapted to crowd modeling, the space colonization algorithm focuses on the competition for space among moving agents. Several behaviors observed in real crowds, including collision avoidance, relationship of crowd density and speed of agents, and the formation of lanes in which people follow each other, are emergent properties of the algorithm. The proposed crowd modeling method is free-of-collision, simple to implement, robust, computationally efficient, and suited to the interactive control of simulated crowds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While functional brain imaging methods can locate the cortical regions subserving particular cognitive functions, the connectivity between the functional areas of the human brain remains poorly understood. Recently, investigators have proposed a method to image neural connectivity noninvasively using a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI measures the molecular diffusion of water along neural pathways. Accurate reconstruction of neural connectivity patterns from DTI has been hindered, however, by the inability of DTI to resolve more than a single axon direction within each imaging voxel. Here, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that can resolve multiple axon directions within a single voxel. The technique, called q-ball imaging, can resolve intravoxel white matter fiber crossing as well as white matter insertions into cortex. The ability of q-ball imaging to resolve complex intravoxel fiber architecture eliminates a key obstacle to mapping neural connectivity in the human brain noninvasively.},

Analysis is performed in the time domain using non-negative least squares, and a new method for applying soft constraints to signal amplitudes is used to improve fitting stability. Initial point truncation and Hankel singular value decomposition water removal are used to reduce baseline interference. Three methods were used to test performance. First, metabolite concentrations from six healthy volunteers at 3 T were compared with LCModel. Second, a Monte-Carlo simulation was performed and results were compared with LCModel to test the accuracy of the new method. Finally, the new algorithm was applied to 1956 spectra, acquired clinically at 1.5 T, to test robustness to noisy, abnormal, artifactual, and poorly shimmed spectra. Discrepancies of less than approximately 20{\%} were found between the main metabolite concentrations determined by TARQUIN and LCModel from healthy volunteer data. The Monte-Carlo simulation revealed that errors in metabolite concentration estimates were comparable with LCModel. TARQUIN analyses were also found to be robust to clinical data of variable quality. In conclusion, TARQUIN has been shown to be an accurate and robust algorithm for the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy data making it suitable for use in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {White matter (WM) fiber tractography (i.e., the reconstruction of the 3D architecture of WM fiber pathways) is known to be an important application of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). For the quantitative evaluation of several fiber-tracking properties, such as accuracy, noise sensitivity, and robustness, synthetic ground-truth DT-MRI data are required. Moreover, an accurate simulated phantom is also required for optimization of the user-defined tractography parameters, and objective comparisons between fiber-tracking algorithms. Therefore, in this study a mathematical framework for simulating DT-MRI data, based on the physical properties of WM fiber bundles, is presented. We obtained a model of a WM fiber bundle by parameterizing the various features that characterize this bundle. We then evaluated three different synthetic DT-MRI models using experimental data in order to test the proposed methodology, and to determine the optimum model and parameter settings for constructing a realistic simulated DT-MRI phantom. Several examples of how the mathematical framework can be applied to compare fiber-tracking algorithms are presented.},

Hence, D-2HG may be an ideal biomarker for both diagnosing and monitoring treatment response targeting IDH mutations.

abstract = {Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1/2) occur often in diffuse gliomas, where they are associated with abnormal accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Monitoring 2-HG levels could provide prognostic information in this disease, but detection strategies that are noninvasive and sufficiently quantitative have yet to be developed. In this study, we address this need by presenting a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) acquisition scheme that uses an ultrahigh magnetic field (≥ 7T) capable of noninvasively detecting 2-HG with quantitative measurements sufficient to differentiate mutant cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2 in human brain tumors. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of in vivo (1)H-MRS spectra discriminated between IDH-mutant tumors and healthy tissue, and separated IDH1 from IDH2 mutations. High-quality spectra enabled the quantification of neurochemical profiles consisting of at least eight metabolites, including 2-HG, glutamate, lactate, and glutathione in both tumor and healthy tissue voxels. Notably, IDH2 mutation produced more 2-HG than IDH1 mutation, consistent with previous findings in cell culture. By offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity, this scheme can quantitatively detect 2-HG and associated metabolites that may accumulate during tumor progression, with implications to better monitor patient responses to therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Measurements of objective response rates are critical to evaluate new glioma therapies. The hallmark metabolic alteration in gliomas with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is the overproduction of oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which plays a key role in malignant transformation. 2HG represents an ideal biomarker to probe treatment response in IDH-mutant glioma patients, and we hypothesized a decrease in 2HG levels would be measureable by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a result of antitumor therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We report a prospective longitudinal imaging study performed in 25 IDH-mutant glioma patients receiving adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. A newly developed 3D MRS imaging was used to non-invasively image 2HG. Paired Student's T-test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment tumor 2HG values. Test-retest measurements were performed to determine the threshold for 2HG functional spectroscopic maps (fSM). Univariate and multivariate regression were performed to correlate 2HG changes with Karnofsky performance score (KPS). RESULTS: We found that mean 2HG (2HG/Cre) levels decreased significantly (median = 48.1{\%}, CI = 27.3-56.5{\%}, P = 0.007) in the post-treatment scan. The volume of decreased 2HG correlates (R2 = 0.88, P = 0.002) with clinical status evaluated by KPS. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that dynamic measurements of 2HG are feasible by 3D fSM, and the decrease of 2HG levels can monitor treatment response in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. Our results indicate that quantitative in vivo 2HG imaging may be employed for precision medicine and early response assessment in clinical trials of therapies targeting IDH-mutant gliomas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple biomarkers are used to quantify the severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to predict outcome. Few are satisfactory. CT and conventional MR imaging underestimate injury and correlate poorly with outcome. New MR imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can provide information about brain ultrastructure by quantifying isotropic and anisotropic water diffusion. Our objective was to determine if changes in anisotropic diffusion in TBI correlate with acute Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and/or Rankin scores at discharge.METHODS:Twenty patients (15 male, five Female; mean age, 31 years) were evaluated. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured at multiple locations and correlated with clinical scores. Results were compared with those of 15 healthy control subjects.RESULTS: ADC values were significantly reduced within the splenium ($\Delta$18{\%}, P = .001). FA values were significantly reduced in the internal capsule ($\Delta$14{\%}; P {\textless} .001) and splenium ($\Delta$16{\%}; P = .002). FA values were significantly correlated with GCS (r = 0.65–0.74; P {\textless} .001) and Rankin (r = 0.68–0.71; P {\textless} .001) scores for the internal capsule and splenium. The correlation between FA and clinical markers was better than for the corresponding ADC values. No correlation was found between ADC of the internal capsule and GCS/Rankin scores.CONCLUSION: DTI reveals changes in the white matter that are correlated with both acute GCS and Rankin scores at discharge. DTI may be a valuable biomarker for the severity of tissue injury and a predictor for outcome.},

abstract = {Short echo time (TE) proton MR spectra of the brain include signals of several metabolites as well as macromolecules. In various pathologies, such as brain tumors and multiple sclerosis (MS), the presence of mobile lipids or pathologically altered macromolecules may provide useful additional diagnostic information. A reliable quantitation of these resonances, however, is often not possible due to the lack of adequate prior knowledge. Furthermore, even if advanced fitting procedures are used, a reliable evaluation of metabolites in the presence of pathological lipids or macromolecules often fails if the latter are omitted in the spectral evaluation. In this study, a method is presented for the simultaneous evaluation of all visible components, including metabolites, lipids, and macromolecules, by the use of the fitting procedure LCModel. A standard basis set of brain metabolites was extended by inclusion of parameterized components for macromolecules and lipids that were derived from metabolite-nulled in vivo spectra of normal brain and high-grade gliomas, respectively. The improved spectral quantitation is demonstrated in glial brain tumors and MS lesions as well as in normal brain. It is pointed out that both macromolecules and lipids must be included to provide a proper spectral evaluation.},

abstract = {Interpreting brain diffusion MRI measurements in terms of neuronal structure at a micrometer level is an exciting unresolved problem. Here we consider diffusion transverse to a bundle of fibers, and show theoretically, as well as using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements in a phantom made of parallel fibers mimicking axons, that the time dependent diffusion coefficient approaches its macroscopic limit slowly, in a (ln t)/. t fashion. The logarithmic singularity arises due to short range disorder in the fiber packing. We identify short range disorder in axonal fibers based on histological data from the splenium, and argue that the time dependent contribution to the overall diffusion coefficient from the extra-axonal water dominates that of the intra-axonal water. This dominance may explain the bias in measuring axon diameters in clinical settings. The short range disorder is also reflected in the asymptotically linear frequency dependence of the diffusion coefficient measured with oscillating gradients, in agreement with recent experiments. Our results relate the measured diffusion to the mesoscopic structure of neuronal tissue, uncovering the sensitivity of diffusion metrics to axonal arrangement within a fiber tract, and providing an alternative interpretation of axonal diameter mapping techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of WHO grades II and III gliomas harbor a missense mutation in the metabolic gene isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and accumulate the metabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG). Prior studies showed that this metabolite can be detected in vivo using proton magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (MRS), but the sensitivity of this methodology and its clinical implications are unknown. METHODS: We developed an MR imaging protocol to integrate 2HG-MRS into routine clinical glioma imaging and examined its performance in 89 consecutive glioma patients. RESULTS: Detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in IDH-mutant gliomas was closely linked to tumor volume, with sensitivity ranging from 8{\%} for small tumors ({\textless}3.4 mL) to 91{\%} for larger tumors ({\textgreater}8 mL). In patients undergoing 2HG-MRS prior to surgery, tumor levels of 2HG corresponded with tumor cellularity but not with tumor grade or mitotic index. Cytoreductive therapy resulted in a gradual decrease in 2HG levels with kinetics that closely mirrored changes in tumor volume. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that 2HG-MRS can be linked with routine MR imaging to provide quantitative measurements of 2HG in glioma and may be useful as an imaging biomarker to monitor the abundance of IDH-mutant tumor cells noninvasively during glioma therapy and disease monitoring.},

abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30. min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10. min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The 1H NMR spectrum of brain tissue was compared with that of cytosol and dialyzed cytosol after removal of low molecular weight molecules ({\textless} 3500 daltons) at 8.4 and 2.1 Tesla. The assignment of specific resonances to macromolecules in 2.1 Tesla, short-TE, localized human brain 1H NMR spectra in vivo was made on the basis of a J-editing method using the spectral parameters (delta, J) and connectivities determined from 2D experiments in vitro. Two prominent connectivities associated with macromolecules in vitro (0.93-2.05 delta and 1.6-3.00 delta) were also detected in vivo by the J-editing method. Advantage was taken of the large difference in measured T1 relaxation times between macromolecule and metabolite resonances in the brain spectrum to acquire 'metabolite-nulled' macromolecule spectra. These spectra appear identical to the spectra of macromolecules isolated in vitro.},

We set out to determine whether the same method could be applied to detect 2HG in IDH-mutant glioblastoma. Forty-four patients harboring glioblastoma underwent pre-operative MRS evaluation to detect 2HG and other metabolites. Presence of IDH-mutations was determined by IDH1 R132H immunohistochemical analysis and DNA sequencing of surgically obtained tissues. Six out of 44 (13.6{\%}) glioblastomas were IDH-mutant. IDH-mutant glioblastoma exhibited significantly higher accumulation of 2HG (median 3.191 vs. 0.000 mM, p {\textless} 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). A cutoff of 2HG = 0.897 mM achieved high sensitivity (100.0{\%}) and specificity (92.59{\%}) in determining IDH-mutation in glioblastoma. Glioblastoma with high 2HG accumulation did not have significantly longer overall survival than glioblastoma with low 2HG accumulation (p = 0.107, log-rank test).

abstract = {This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the optimal value of the diffusion weighting factor b for estimating white-matter fiber orientations using diffusion MRI with a standard spherical sampling scheme. We devise an algorithm for determining the optimal echo time, pulse width, and pulse separation in the pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence for a specific value of b. The Monte Carlo simulations provide an estimate of the optimal value of b for recovering one and two fiber orientations. We show that the optimum is largely independent of the noise level in the measurements and the number of gradient directions and that the optimum depends only weakly on the diffusion anisotropy, the maximum gradient strength, and the spin-spin relaxation time. The optimum depends strongly on the mean diffusivity. In brain tissue, the optima we estimate are in the ranges [0.7, 1.0] × 109s m-2and [2.2, 2.8] × 109s m-2for the one- and two-fiber cases, respectively. The best b for estimating the fractional anisotropy is slightly higher than for estimating fiber directions in the one-fiber case and slightly lower in the two-fiber case. To estimate Tr(D) in the one-fiber case, the optimal setting is higher still. Simulations suggest that a ratio of high to low b measurements of 5 to 1 is a good compromise for measuring fiber directions and size and shape indices. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Measurements were performed using a stimulated-echo pulse-sequence on n-decane as well as on polyethylene glycol (PEG) mixed with different concentrations of water, in order to obtain bi-exponential signal decay curves. The diffusion coefficients as well as the modelled diffusional kurtosis K(fit) were obtained from the signal decay curve, while the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the diffusional kurtosis K were obtained from the displacement distribution. Simulations of restricted diffusion, under conditions similar to those obtainable with a clinical MRI scanner, were carried out assuming various degrees of violation of the short gradient pulse (SGP) condition and of the long diffusion time limit. The results indicated that an MRI system can not be used for quantification of structural sizes less than about 10 microm by means of FWHM since the parameter underestimates the confinements due to violation of the SGP condition. However, FWHM can still be used as an important contrast parameter. The obtained kurtosis values were lower than expected from theory and the results showed that care must be taken when interpreting a kurtosis estimate deviating from zero.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: Variable daily sleep (i.e., higher intraindividual variability; IIV) is associated with negative health consequences, but potential physiological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study examined the associations between sleep timing, duration, and quality IIV and physiological dysregulation, with diurnal cortisol trajectories as a proximal outcome, and allostatic load (AL) as a multi-system distal outcome. Methods: Participants are 436 adults (Mage±SD=54.1±11.7, 60.3{\%} women) from the Midlife in the United States study. Sleep was objectively assessed using 7-day actigraphy. Diurnal cortisol was measured via saliva samples (4/day for 4 consecutive days). AL was measured using 23 biomarkers from 7 systems (inflammatory, HPA, metabolic glucose and lipid, cardiovascular, parasympathetic, sympathetic) using a validated bi-factor model. Linear and quadratic effects of sleep IIV were estimated using a validated Bayesian model. Results: Controlling for covariates, more variable sleep timing (p=.04 for risetime, p=.097 for bedtime) and total sleep time (TST; p=.02), but not mean sleep variables, were associated with flatter cortisol diurnal slope. More variable sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset, later average bedtime, and shorter TST were associated with higher AL adjusting for age and sex (p-values{\textless}.05); after controlling for all covariates, however, only later mean bedtime remained significantly associated with higher AL (p=.04). Conclusions: In a community sample of adults, more variable sleep patterns were associated with blunted diurnal cortisol trajectories, but not with higher multi-system physiological dysregulation. The associations between sleep IIV and overall health are likely complex, including multiple biopsychosocial determinants, and require further investigation.},

abstract = {Axonal density and diameter are two fundamental properties of brain white matter. Recently, advanced diffusion MRI techniques have made these two parameters accessible in vivo. However, the techniques available to estimate such parameters are still under development. For example, current methods to map axonal diameters capture relative trends over different structures, but consistently over-estimate absolute diameters. Axonal density estimates are more accessible experimentally, but different modeling approaches exist and the impact of the experimental parameters has not been thoroughly quantified, potentially leading to incompatibility of results obtained in different studies using different techniques. Here, we characterise the impact of diffusion time on axonal density and diameter estimates using Monte Carlo simulations and STEAM diffusion MRI at 7 T on 9 healthy volunteers. We show that axonal density and diameter estimates strongly depend on diffusion time, with diameters almost invariably overestimated and density both over and underestimated for some commonly used models. Crucially, we also demonstrate that these biases are reduced when the model accounts for diffusion time dependency in the extra-axonal space. For axonal density estimates, both upward and downward bias in different situations are removed by modeling extra-axonal time-dependence, showing increased accuracy in these estimates. For axonal diameter estimates, we report increased accuracy in ground truth simulations and axonal diameter estimates decreased away from high values given by earlier models and towards known values in the human corpus callosum when modeling extra-axonal time-dependence. Axonal diameter feasibility under both advanced and clinical settings is discussed in the light of the proposed advances.},

abstract = {The processes of diffusion in multi-compartmental tissue models are discussed using an analytical model of diffusion with exchange. Diffusion in the intracellular compartment has been found to be highly restricted, with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(1)) dependent on the experimental parameters. Extracellular diffusion mediated by tortuosity, depends on tissue geometry, but not on the experimental conditions. Both the intra- and extracellular diffusion can be anisotropic and exhibit non-monoexponential behavior. The cell membrane permeability is shown to significantly influence the diffusion measurement in tissues. In consequence, the phenomenological, bi-exponential models of diffusion cannot directly estimate the intrinsic characteristics of intra- and extracellular water. The mechanisms of the ADC decrease after stroke are also discussed.},

This demand and the computational power available from current computer hardware have together stimulated the rapid development of numerical methods for partial di?erential equations—a development that encompasses convergence analyses and implementational aspects of software packages. In 1988 we started work on the ?rst German edition of our book, which appeared in 1992. Our aim was to give students a textbook that contained the basic concepts and ideas behind most numerical methods for partial di?er- tial equations. The success of this ?rst edition and the second edition in 1994 encouraged us, ten years later, to write an almost completely new version, taking into account comments from colleagues and students and drawing on the enormous progress made in the numerical analysis of partial di?erential equations in recent times. The present English version slightly improves the third German edition of 2005: we have corrected some minor errors and added additional material and references.},

abstract = {The finite element method (FEM) is a widely employed numerical technique for approximating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) in various science and engineering applications. Many of these applications benefit from fast execution of the FEM pipeline. One way to accelerate the FEM pipeline is by exploiting advances in modern computational hardware, such as the many-core streaming processors like the graphical processing unit (GPU). In this paper, we present the algorithms and data-structures necessary to move the entire FEM pipeline to the GPU. First we propose an efficient GPU-based algorithm to generate local element information and to assemble the global linear system associated with the FEM discretization of an elliptic PDE. To solve the corresponding linear system efficiently on the GPU, we implement a conjugate gradient method preconditioned with a geometry-informed algebraic multigrid (AMG) method preconditioner. We propose a new fine-grained parallelism strategy, a corresponding multigrid cycling stage and efficient data mapping to the many-core architecture of GPU. Comparison of our on-GPU assembly versus a traditional serial implementation on the CPU achieves up to an 87× speedup. Focusing on the linear system solver alone, we achieve a speedup of up to 51× versus use of a comparable state-of-the-art serial CPU linear system solver. Furthermore, the method compares favorably with other GPU-based, sparse, linear solvers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Localized short-echo-time (1)H-MR spectra of human brain contain contributions of many low-molecular-weight metabolites and baseline contributions of macromolecules. Two approaches to model such spectra are compared and the data acquisition sequence, optimized for reproducibility, is presented. Modeling relies on prior knowledge constraints and linear combination of metabolite spectra. Investigated was what can be gained by basis parameterization, i.e., description of basis spectra as sums of parametric lineshapes. Effects of basis composition and addition of experimentally measured macromolecular baselines were investigated also. Both fitting methods yielded quantitatively similar values, model deviations, error estimates, and reproducibility in the evaluation of 64 spectra of human gray and white matter from 40 subjects. Major advantages of parameterized basis functions are the possibilities to evaluate fitting parameters separately, to treat subgroup spectra as independent moieties, and to incorporate deviations from straightforward metabolite models. It was found that most of the 22 basis metabolites used may provide meaningful data when comparing patient cohorts. In individual spectra, sums of closely related metabolites are often more meaningful. Inclusion of a macromolecular basis component leads to relatively small, but significantly different tissue content for most metabolites. It provides a means to quantitate baseline contributions that may contain crucial clinical information.},

Water diffuses, relaxes, and exchanges in three compartments-intracellular, extracellular, and myelin sheath. Exchange between compartments is defined so as to depend on the diffusion coefficients and the compartment sizes. Based on the model, it is proposed that an additive "baseline tensor" that correlates with intraaxonal water volume be included in the computation. Anisotropy and tortuosity calculated from such analysis may correspond better to tract ultrastructure than if calculated without the baseline. According to the model, reduced extracellular volume causes increased baseline and reduced apparent diffusion. Depending on the pulse sequence, reduced permeability can cause an increase in both the baseline and apparent diffusion.},

abstract = {Diffusion of molecules in brain and other tissues is important in a wide range of biological processes and measurements ranging from the delivery of drugs to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging is a powerful noninvasive method to characterize neuronal tissue in the human brain in vivo. As a first step toward understanding the relationship between the measured macroscopic apparent diffusion tensor and underlying microscopic compartmental geometry and physical properties, we treat a white matter fascicle as an array of identical thick-walled cylindrical tubes arranged periodically in a regular lattice and immersed in an outer medium. Both square and hexagonal arrays are considered. The diffusing molecules may have different diffusion coefficients and concentrations (or densities) in different domains, namely within the tubes' inner core, membrane, myelin sheath, and within the outer medium. Analytical results are used to explore the effects of a large range of microstructural and compositional parameters on the apparent diffusion tensor and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, allowing the characterization of diffusion in normal physiological conditions as well as changes occurring in development, disease, and aging. Implications for diffusion tensor imaging and for the possible in situ estimation of microstructural parameters from diffusion-weighted MR data are discussed in the context of this modeling framework. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Multisite exchange models have been applied frequently to quantify measurements of transverse relaxation and diffusion in living tissues. Although the simplicity of such models is attractive, the precise relationship of the model parameters to tissue properties may be difficult to ascertain. Here, we investigate numerically a two-compartment exchange (K{\"{a}}rger) model as applied to diffusion in a system of randomly packed identical parallel cylinders with permeable walls, representing cells with permeable membranes, that may serve particularly as a model for axons in the white matter of the brain. By performing Monte Carlo simulations of restricted diffusion, we show that the K{\"{a}}rger model may provide a reasonable coarse-grained description of the diffusion-weighted signal in the long time limit, as long as the cell membranes are sufficiently impermeable, i.e. whenever the residence time in a cell is much longer than the time it takes to diffuse across it. For larger permeabilities, the exchange time obtained from fitting to the K{\"{a}}rger model overestimates the actual exchange time, leading to an underestimated value of cell membrane permeability.},

KM basically ignores exact microstructure but says you have one pool for intracellular and one pool for extra and the resulting signal is the combination of the two, with exchange between the pools allowed.

abstract = {Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging is best known for its spectacular use in medical tomography. However the method has potential applications in biology, materials science, and chemical physics, some of which have begun to be realized as laboratory NRM spectrometers have been adapted to enable small scale imaging. NMR microscopy has available a rich variety of contrast including molecular specificity and sensitivity to molecular dynamics. In NMR imaging the signal is acquired in k-space, a dimension which bears a Fourier relationship with the positions of nuclear spins. A dynamic analogue of k-space imaging is the Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) experiment in which the signal is acquired in q-space, conjugate to the distances moved by the spins over a well-defined time interval. q-space microscopy provides images of the nuclear self-correlation function with a resolution some two orders of magnitude better than is possible in imaging the nuclear density. As well as revealing the spectrum of molecular motion, PGSE NMR can be used to study morphology in porous systems through the influence of motional boundaries. This book explores principles and common themes underlying these two variants of NMR Microscopy, providing many examples of their use. The methods discussed here are of importance in fundamental biological and physical research, as well as having applications in a wide variety of industries, including those concerned with petrochemicals, polymers, biotechnology, food processing and natural product processing.},

abstract = {Direct measurement of tissue microstructure with diffusion MRI offers a new class of markers, such as axon diameters, that give more specific information about tissue than measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging. The existing techniques of this kind assume a single axon orientation in the tissue model, which may be a reasonable approximation only for the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as the corpus callosum. For most other areas, orientation dispersion is not negligible and, if unaccounted for, leads to overestimation of the axon diameters, prohibiting their accurate mapping over the whole brain. Here we propose a new model that captures the effect of orientation dispersion explicitly. A numerical scheme is developed to compute the diffusion signal prescribed by the proposed model efficiently, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the axon diameter and orientation dispersion. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that the new model provides an axon diameter index that is robust to the presence of orientation dispersion. Results on in vivo human data show reduced axon diameter index and better agreement with histology compared to previous methods suggesting improvements in the axon diameter estimate. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Mescher1998,
abstract = {Water suppression is typically performed in vivo by exciting the longitudinal magnetization in combination with dephasing, or by using frequency-selective coherence generation. MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to design and implement constant adiabaticity gradient modulated pulses that have improved slice profiles and reduced artifacts for spectroscopic imaging on 3 T clinical scanners equipped with standard hardware. The newly proposed pulses were designed using the gradient offset independent adiabaticity (GOIA, Tannus and Garwood [13]) method using WURST modulation for RF and gradient waveforms. The GOIA-WURST pulses were compared with GOIA-HSn (GOIA based on nth-order hyperbolic secant) and FOCI (frequency offset corrected inversion) pulses of the same bandwidth and duration. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements in phantoms and healthy volunteers are presented. GOIA-WURST pulses provide improved slice profile that have less slice smearing for off-resonance frequencies compared to GOIA-HSn pulses. The peak RF amplitude of GOIA-WURST is much lower (40{\%} less) than FOCI but slightly higher (14.9{\%} more) to GOIA-HSn. The quality of spectra as shown by the analysis of lineshapes, eddy currents artifacts, subcutaneous lipid contamination and SNR is improved for GOIA-WURST. GOIA-WURST pulse tested in this work shows that reliable spectroscopic imaging could be obtained in routine clinical setup and might facilitate the use of clinical spectroscopy. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This work is an attempt to bring familiarity and to fulfill the preliminary needs of anyone interested in learning more about this subject. The response of magnetization to stimuli produced by adiabatic pulses is analyzed using vector representations in a frequency modulated rotating frame. The first section deals with basic principles of amplitude and frequency modulated pulses and a vector representation in a second rotating frame is used to explain how the adiabatic condition can be satisfied. The subsequent section explains the principles of offset independent adiabaticity. These principles are then used to design optimal functions for the amplitude, frequency, and magnetic field gradient modulations for adiabatic inversion pulses. The last section considers some practical aspects for those who want to develop methodologies involving adiabatic pulses.},

abstract = {Simulations of diffusion in neural tissues have traditionally been limited to analytical solutions, to grid-based solvers, or to small-scale Monte Carlo simulations. None of these approaches has had the capability to simulate realistic complex neural tissues on the scale of even a single voxel of reasonable (i.e., clinical) size. An approach is described that combines a Monte Carlo Brownian dynamics simulator capable of simulating diffusion in arbitrarily complex polygonal geometries with a signal integrator flexible enough to handle a variety of pulse sequences. Taken together, this package provides a complete and general simulation environment for diffusion MRI experiments. The simulator is validated against analytical solutions for unbounded diffusion and diffusion between parallel plates. Further results are shown for aligned fibers, varying packing density and permeability, and for crossing straight fibers.},
annote = {Another MC simulation technique. Here they embed MCell, an established simulator of cellular microphysiology within an MRI simulator. 
The MRI simulator tracks the position, state, signal amplitude and phase throughout the simulations. 

Here, unlike Camino, the step length changes from step to step which they say allows them to reduce the number of timesteps needed in the gradient block. Additionally, they store a look-up table of radial directions rather than generating one each time.

MCell allows the diffusion coefficient to be updated when the particle diffuses through a boundary, allowing them to create models with different diffusion coefficient in intra and extra axonal spaces. 

They just compare the results of their simulations to known results.

Second Monte Carlo study I found. Here they simulate spinal cord white matter as permeable cylinders.

The idea is that they can measure the ADC parallel and perpendicular to fibres to see whether there's damange to the fibres. 

Cylinders are simulated on square and hexagonal lattices. 

Simulations are very similar to Szafer et. al 1995 but has two differences - T2 is ignored and rather than reflecting a particle, it is just left where it is. This is to prevent the need to track multiple reflections. 

Use a finite length gradient pulse. 

Compared results with analytical solutions for simple environments and also with Szafer et al.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In the brain, there is growing interest in using the temporal diffusion spectrum to characterize axonal geometry in white matter because of the potential to be more sensitive to small pores compared to conventional time-dependent diffusion. However, analytical expressions for the diffusion spectrum of particles have only been derived for simple, restricting geometries such as cylinders, which are often used as a model for intra-axonal diffusion. The extra-axonal space is more complex, but the diffusion spectrum has largely not been modeled. We propose a model for the extra-axonal space, which can be used for interpretation of experimental data. THEORY AND METHODS: An empirical model describing the extra-axonal space diffusion spectrum was compared with simulated spectra. Spectra were simulated using Monte Carlo methods for idealized, regularly and randomly packed axons over a wide range of packing densities and spatial scales. The model parameters are related to the microstructural properties of tortuosity, axonal radius, and separation for regularly packed axons and pore size for randomly packed axons. RESULTS: Forward model predictions closely matched simulations. The model fitted the simulated spectra well and accurately estimated microstructural properties. CONCLUSIONS: This simple model provides expressions that relate the diffusion spectrum to biologically relevant microstructural properties.

abstract = {Numerical analysis presents different faces to the world. For mathematicians it is a bona fide mathematical theory with an applicable flavour. For scientists and engineers it is a practical, applied subject, part of the standard repertoire of modelling techniques. For computer scientists it is a theory on the interplay of computer architecture and algorithms for real-number calculations. The tension between these standpoints is the driving force of this book, which presents a rigorous account of the fundamentals of numerical analysis of both ordinary and partial differential equations. The point of departure is mathematical but the exposition strives to maintain a balance between theoretical, algorithmic and applied aspects of the subject. In detail, topics covered include numerical solution of ordinary differential equations by multistep and Runge-Kutta methods; finite difference and finite elements techniques for the Poisson equation; a variety of algorithms to solve large, sparse algebraic systems; methods for parabolic and hyperbolic differential equations and techniques of their analysis. The book is accompanied by an appendix that presents brief back-up in a number of mathematical topics. Dr Iserles concentrates on fundamentals: deriving methods from first principles, analysing them with a variety of mathematical techniques and occasionally discussing questions of implementation and applications. By doing so, he is able to lead the reader to theoretical understanding of the subject without neglecting its practical aspects. The outcome is a textbook that is mathematically honest and rigorous and provides its target audience with a wide range of skills in both ordinary and partial differential equations.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of the apparent rate of water diffusion in tumors are sensitive to variations in tissue cellularity, which have been shown useful for characterizing tumors and their responses to treatments. However, because of technical limitations on most MRI systems, conventional pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) methods measure relatively long time scales, during which water molecules may encounter diffusion barriers at multiple spatial scales, including those much greater than typical cell dimensions. As such they cannot distinguish changes on subcellular scales from gross changes in cell density. Oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) methods have the potential to distinguish effects on restriction at much shorter time and length scales. Both PGSE and OGSE methods have been studied numerically by simulating diffusion in a three-dimensional, multicompartment tissue model. The results show that conventional measurements with the PGSE method cannot selectively probe variations over short length scales and, therefore, are relatively insensitive to intracellular structure, whereas results using OGSE methods at moderate gradient frequencies are affected by variations in cell nuclear sizes and can distinguish tissues that differ only over subcellular length scales. This additional sensitivity suggests that OGSE imaging may have significant advantages over conventional PGSE methods for characterizing tumors.},

The resulting coherence patterns appear in plots of the normalized PGSE signal intensities as a function of the spatial wave vector Q in a so-called q-space plot. The origin of these phenomena and their mathematical and physical underpinnings are now well established. We have conducted a number of studies of diffusion-coherence phenomena in suspensions of red blood cells and have made extensive use of computer simulations of molecular diffusion in virtual lattices of cells to aid in the interpretation and analysis of experimental data. In the current work we extended the canonical model used in these studies to investigate the effect that varying the packing arrangement of cells in the suspension has on the coherence patterns, as seen in q-space plots. We show that changes in the packing arrangement of cells are reflected in the q-space plots and in the results of diffusion tensor analysis and thus we speculate upon the possible clinical importance of these findings.},

The (1) H resonances of the J-coupled spins of 2HG are extensively overlapped with signals from other metabolites. Here, we report a comparative study at 3 T of the utility of the point-resolved spectroscopy sequence with a standard short TE (35 ms) and a long TE (97 ms), which had been theoretically designed for the detection of the 2HG 2.25-ppm resonance. The performance of the methods is evaluated using data from phantoms, seven healthy volunteers and 22 subjects with IDH-mutated gliomas. The results indicate that TE = 97 ms provides higher detectability of 2HG than TE = 35 ms, and that this improved capability is gained when data are analyzed with basis spectra that include the effects of the volume localizing radiofrequency and gradient pulses.},

abstract = {Assessment of radiation and chemotherapy efficacy for brain cancer patients is traditionally accomplished by measuring changes in tumor size several months after therapy has been administered. The ability to use noninvasive imaging during the early stages of fractionated therapy to determine whether a particular treatment will be effective would provide an opportunity to optimize individual patient management and avoid unnecessary systemic toxicity, expense, and treatment delays. We investigated whether changes in the Brownian motion of water within tumor tissue as quantified by using diffusion MRI could be used as a biomarker for early prediction of treatment response in brain cancer patients. Twenty brain tumor patients were examined by standard and diffusion MRI before initiation of treatment. Additional images were acquired 3 weeks after initiation of chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Images were coregistered to pretreatment scans, and changes in tumor water diffusion values were calculated and displayed as a functional diffusion map (fDM) for correlation with clinical response. Of the 20 patients imaged during the course of therapy, 6 were classified as having a partial response, 6 as stable disease, and 8 as progressive disease. The fDMs were found to predict patient response at 3 weeks from the start of treatment, revealing that early changes in tumor diffusion values could be used as a prognostic indicator of subsequent volumetric tumor response. Overall, fDM analysis provided an early biomarker for predicting treatment response in brain tumor patients.},

abstract = {Prior models used to clarify which aspects of tissue microstructure mostly affect intracellular diffusion and corresponding diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) signal have focused on relatively simple geometrical descriptions of the cellular microenvironment (spheres, randomly oriented cylinders, etc{\ldots}), neglecting finer morphological details which may have an important role. Some types of neurons present high density of spines; and astrocytes and macroglial cells processes present leaflets, which may all impact the diffusion process. Here, we use Monte-Carlo simulations of many particles diffusing in cylindrical compartments with secondary structures mimicking spines and leaflets of neuronal and glial cell fibers, to investigate to what extent the diffusion-weighted signal of intracellular molecules is sensitive to spines/leaflets density and length. In order to study the specificity of DW-MR signal to these kinds of secondary structures, beading-like geometry is simulated as “control” deviation from smooth cylinder too. Results suggest that: a) the estimated intracellular tortuosity increases as spines/leaflets density or length (beading amplitude) increase; b) the tortuosity limit is reached for diffusion time td{\textgreater}200 ms for metabolites and td{\textgreater}70 ms for water molecules, suggesting that the effects of these finer morphological details are negligible at tdlonger than these threshold values; c) fiber diameter is overestimated, while intracellular diffusivity is underestimated, when simple geometrical models based on hollow smooth cylinders are used; d) apparent surface-to-volume, S/V, ratio estimated by linear fit of high frequency OG data appears to be an excellent estimation of the actual S/V ratio, even in the presence of secondary structures, and it increases as spines and leaflets density or length increase (while decreasing as beadings amplitude increases). Comparison between numerical simulations and multimodal metabolites DW-MRS experiments in vivo in mouse brain shows that these fine structures may affect the DW-MRS signal and the derived diffusion metrics consistently with their expected density and geometrical features. This work suggests that finer structures of cell morphology have non-negligible effects on intracellular molecules' diffusion that may be measured by using multimodal DW-MRS approaches, stimulating future developments and applications.},

abstract = {Image reconstruction for magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) requires specialized spatial and spectral data processing methods and benefits from the use of several sources of prior information that are not commonly available, including MRI-derived tissue segmentation, morphological analysis and spectral characteristics of the observed metabolites. In addition, incorporating information obtained from MRI data can enhance the display of low-resolution metabolite images and multiparametric and regional statistical analysis methods can improve detection of altered metabolite distributions. As a result, full MRSI processing and analysis can involve multiple processing steps and several different data types. In this paper, a processing environment is described that integrates and automates these data processing and analysis functions for imaging of proton metabolite distributions in the normal human brain. The capabilities include normalization of metabolite signal intensities and transformation into a common spatial reference frame, thereby allowing the formation of a database of MR-measured human metabolite values as a function of acquisition, spatial and subject parameters. This development is carried out under the MIDAS project (Metabolite Imaging and Data Analysis System), which provides an integrated set of MRI and MRSI processing functions. It is anticipated that further development and distribution of these capabilities will facilitate more widespread use of MRSI for diagnostic imaging, encourage the development of standardized MRSI acquisition, processing and analysis methods and enable improved mapping of metabolite distributions in the human brain.},

abstract = {This article describes the development and application of an integrated, generalized, and efficient Monte Carlo simulation system for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), named Diffusion Microscopist Simulator (DMS). DMS comprises a random walk Monte Carlo simulator and an MR image synthesizer. The former has the capacity to perform large-scale simulations of Brownian dynamics in the virtual environments of neural tissues at various levels of complexity, and the latter is flexible enough to synthesize dMRI datasets from a variety of simulated MRI pulse sequences. The aims of DMS are to give insights into the link between the fundamental diffusion process in biological tissues and the features observed in dMRI, as well as to provide appropriate ground-truth information for the development, optimization, and validation of dMRI acquisition schemes for different applications. The validity, efficiency, and potential applications of DMS are evaluated through four benchmark experiments, including the simulated dMRI of white matter fibers, the multiple scattering diffusion imaging, the biophysical modeling of polar cell membranes, and the high angular resolution diffusion imaging and fiber tractography of complex fiber configurations. We expect that this novel software tool would be substantially advantageous to clarify the interrelationship between dMRI and the microscopic characteristics of brain tissues, and to advance the biophysical modeling and the dMRI methodologies.},

The idea is that they can measure the ADC parallel and perpendicular to fibres to see whether there's damange to the fibres. 

Cylinders are simulated on square and hexagonal lattices. 

Simulations are very similar to Szafer et. al 1995 but has two differences - T2 is ignored and rather than reflecting a particle, it is just left where it is. This is to prevent the need to track multiple reflections. 

Use a finite length gradient pulse.

abstract = {This paper proposes and tests a technique for imaging orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density in white matter using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3. T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware. This demonstration motivates further refinement, validation, and evaluation of the precise nature of the indices and the influence of potential confounds. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {L-2-Hydroxyglutaric (L-2-HG) aciduria is a rare inherited metabolic disease usually observed in children. Patients present a very slowly progressive deterioration with cerebellar ataxia, mild or severe mental retardation, and various other clinical signs including extrapyramidal and pyramidal symptoms, and seizures. The disease is characterized by increased levels of L-2-HG in body fluids such as urine and cerebrospinal fluid. We report on two sisters from consanguineous parents, in whom L-2-HG aciduria was diagnosed at an adult age. Although magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic findings were severely abnormal in both, they experienced a different clinical course. The older sister presented with severe mental retardation, recurrent epileptic seizures, and progressive deterioration in her ability to walk and to talk; she is now confined to a wheelchair with severe speech deficit. In contrast, the younger sister only had a few epileptic seizures in childhood and moderate mental retardation, is still able to walk, and performs manual work, and has a social life in a specialized institution for moderately mentally handicapped persons. For the two patients, a complete deletion of exon 9 was demonstrated in a gene located on chromosome 14q22.1, which most probably encodes for L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. The pathological findings observed in this metabolic disorder could therefore be related to a toxic effect of L-2-hydroxyglutarate on the central nervous system, although the presence of other toxic metabolites cannot be excluded.},

Calculated ADCs disagree with values obtained from the widely used "fast exchange" formula. Effects of differences between intracellular and extracellular T2 relaxation times on measured values of ADC and T2 are discussed. The general analysis is specifically applied to the changes occurring in ADC following ischemic insults to brain tissue. It is found that although membranes affect ADC significantly, the observed changes in diffusion cannot be due to reduced membrane permeabilities. They may result from the combined effect of changes in cellular volume fraction, extracellular and intracellular diffusion.},
annote = {First (that I know) paper simulating diffusion MRI using Monte Carlo methods. 

Treat tissue as a periodic array of boxes with partially permeable membranes embeded in extracellular medium. 
Intra and extracellular components can have different diffusion coefficient and T2. 

Each spin carries a transverse magnetisation and T2 directly simulated at each step. 

Spins colliding with wall either reflected or transmitted with probability determined by the permeability. The probability is determined from the permeability according to [3].

Gradients are treated as instantaneous. The first one being applied immediately and the second being applied after Delta. There are examples with finite gradients however. 

Signal is measured as sum of transverse magnetisation immediately after second gradient.

Second Monte Carlo study I found. Here they simulate spinal cord white matter as permeable cylinders.

The idea is that they can measure the ADC parallel and perpendicular to fibres to see whether there's damange to the fibres. 

Cylinders are simulated on square and hexagonal lattices. 

Simulations are very similar to Szafer et. al 1995 but has two differences - T2 is ignored and rather than reflecting a particle, it is just left where it is. This is to prevent the need to track multiple reflections. 

Use a finite length gradient pulse. 

Compared results with analytical solutions for simple environments and also with Szafer et al.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI has been proposed as a non-invasive technique for axonal diameter mapping. However, accurate estimation of small diameters requires strong gradients, which is a challenge for the transition of the technique from preclinical to clinical MRI scanners, since these have weaker gradients. In this work, we develop a framework to estimate the lower bound for accurate diameter estimation, which we refer to as the resolution limit. We analyse only the contribution from the intra-axonal space and assume that axons can be represented by impermeable cylinders. To address the growing interest in using techniques for diffusion encoding that go beyond the conventional single diffusion encoding (SDE) sequence, we present a generalised analysis capable of predicting the resolution limit regardless of the gradient waveform. Using this framework, waveforms were optimised to minimise the resolution limit. The results show that, for parallel cylinders, the SDE experiment is optimal in terms of yielding the lowest possible resolution limit. In the presence of orientation dispersion, diffusion encoding sequences with square-wave oscillating gradients were optimal. The resolution limit for standard clinical MRI scanners (maximum gradient strength 60-80 mT/m) was found to be between 4 and 8 mum, depending on the noise levels and the level of orientation dispersion. For scanners with a maximum gradient strength of 300 mT/m, the limit was reduced to between 2 and 5 mum.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and mass spectroscopy studies have shown accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gliomas. IDH mutation is known to be a powerful positive prognostic marker in malignant gliomas. Hence, 2HG accumulation in gliomas was assumed to be a positive prognostic factor in gliomas, but this has not yet been proven. Here, we analyzed 52 patients harboring World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and III gliomas utilizing 3.0-tesla MRS. RESULTS: Mutant IDH gliomas showed significantly higher accumulation of 2HG (median 5.077 vs. 0.000, p =0.0002, Mann-Whitney test). 2HG was detectable in all mutant IDH gliomas, whereas in 10 out of 27 (37.0{\%}) wild-type IDH gliomas, 2HG was below the detectable range (2HG =0) (p =0.0003, chi-squared test). Screening for IDH mutation by 2HG analysis was highly sensitive (cutoff 2HG =1.489 mM, sensitivity 100.0{\%}, specificity 72.2{\%}). Gliomas with high 2HG accumulation had better overall survival than gliomas with low 2HG accumulation (p =0.0401, Kaplan-Meier analysis). DISCUSSION: 2HG accumulation detected by 3.0-tesla MRS not only correlates well with IDH status, but also positively correlates with survival in WHO grade II and III gliomas.},

The birth defects in this cohort were compared with those in a control group of 454 births to women who were not exposed to chloroquine, most of whom lived in non-malarious areas. The proportion of birth defects in the exposed group was not significantly different from that in the control group. This observation must be considered within the limitations of the study, which could detect only a strong teratogenic effect. It could not exclude risks lower than a 5.7-fold increase in the incidence of birth defects when chloroquine was used. Women using chloroquine during pregnancy for chemosuppression of malaria can be reassured that it is not a strong teratogen, but if it is to be used the risk of developing malaria should be balanced against the lack of data to determine whether it carries a low teratogenic risk.},

Extracellular electrode pressure can increase tr and its variability by 2- to 3-fold. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled passive acetylcholine diffusion through a vesicle fusion pore expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(-1) (rapid, from endplate omega figure appearance) or 0.275 nm x ms(-1) (slow, from mast cell exocytosis). Simulated mEPCs obtained with rapid expansion reproduced tr and the overall shape of our experimental mEPCs, and were similar to simulated mEPCs obtained with instant acetylcholine release. We conclude that passive transmitter diffusion, coupled with rapid expansion of the fusion pore, is sufficient to explain the time course of experimentally measured synaptic currents with trs of less than 100 micros.},

abstract = {Which aspects of tissue microstructure affect diffusion weighted MRI signals? Prior models, many of which use Monte-Carlo simulations, have focused on relatively simple models of the cellular microenvironment and have not considered important anatomic details. With the advent of higher-order analysis models for diffusion imaging, such as high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), more realistic models are necessary. This paper presents and evaluates the reproducibility of simulations of diffusion in complex geometries. Our framework is quantitative, does not require specialized hardware, is easily implemented with little programming experience, and is freely available as open-source software. Models may include compartments with different diffusivities, permeabilities, and T2 time constants using both parametric (e.g. spheres and cylinders) and arbitrary (e.g. mesh-based) geometries. Three-dimensional diffusion displacement probability functions are mapped with high reproducibility, and thus can be readily used to assess reproducibility of diffusion-derived contrasts.},

Seems as though the geometries in RWS are made using constructive solig geometries, which may be a better idea since I think it already has inherent knowledge of the solid geometry (i.e. where in space is inside the shape and where is outside).

The boundaries can have different permeabilities in-{\textgreater}out vs out-{\textgreater}in.

At 3 T, detection of 2-HG with magnetic resonance spectroscopy is challenging because of metabolite signal overlap and spectral pattern modulation by slice selection and chemical shift displacement. Using density matrix simulations and phantom experi-ments, an optimized semi-LASER scheme (echo time ϭ 110 milliseconds) considerably improves localization of the 2-HG spin system compared with that of an existing point-resolved spectroscopy sequence. This results in a visible 2-HG peak in the in vivo spectra at 1.9 ppm in the majority of isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutated tumors. Detected concentrations of 2-HG were similar using both sequences, although the use of semi-LASER generated narrower confidence intervals. Signal overlap with glutamate and glutamine, as measured by pairwise fitting correlation, was reduced. Lactate was readily detectable across patients with glioma using the method presented here (mean Cram{\'{e}}r–Rao lower bound: 10{\%} Ϯ 2{\%}). Together with more robust 2-HG detection, long-echo time semi-LASER offers the potential to investigate tumor metabolism and stratify patients in vivo at 3 T.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the diffusion-related signal attenuation curves (signal-vs.-b curves) measured perpendicular and parallel to the neuronal fibers of the corticospinal tract in vivo and to determine whether effects of restricted diffusion could be observed when varying the diffusion time (TD). A biexponential model and a two-compartment model including exchange according to the K{\"{a}}rger formalism were employed to analyze the signal-vs.-b curves. To validate the two-compartment model, restricted diffusion with exchange was simulated for uniformly sized cylinders, using different diameters and exchange times. The model was shown to retrieve the simulated parameters well, also when the short gradient pulse approximation was not met. The in vivo measurements performed perpendicular to the tracts, using b values up to 28000 s/mm2and TDvalues between 64 and 256 ms, did not show the effects of restricted diffusion as expected from previous ex vivo studies. The applied two-compartment model yielded an average axonal diameter of about 4 $\mu$m and an intracellular exchange time of about 300 ms, but did not fit statistically well to the data. In conclusion, this study indicates that if the diffusion is modeled as two compartments, of which one is restricted, exchange must be included in the model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The discovery of somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes through a genome-wide mutational analysis in glioblastoma represents a milestone event in cancer biology. The nature of the heterozygous, point mutations mapping to arginine residues involved in the substrate binding inspired several research teams to investigate their impact on the biochemical activity of these enzymes. Soon, it became clear that the mutations identified impaired the ability of IDH1 and IDH2 to catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ($\alpha$KG), whereas conferring a gain of a novel enzymatic activity leading to the reduction of $\alpha$KG to the metabolite D2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Across glioma as well as several hematologic malignancies, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 have shown prognostic value. Several hypotheses implicating the elevated levels of D-2HG and tumorigenesis, and the therapeutic potential of targeting mutant IDH enzymes will be discussed.},

abstract = {The oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is a signature biomarker in various cancers, where it accumulates as a result of mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). The metabolic source of 2-HG, in a wide variety of cancers, dictates both its generation and also potential therapeutic strategies, but this remains difficult to access in vivo. Here, utilizing patient-derived chondrosarcoma cells harboring endogenous mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, we report that 2-HG can be rapidly generated from glutamine in vitro. Then, using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HP-MRI), we demonstrate that in vivo HP [1-13C] glutamine can be used to non-invasively measure glutamine-derived HP 2-HG production. This can be readily modulated utilizing a selective IDH1 inhibitor, opening the door to targeting glutamine-derived 2-HG therapeutically. Rapid rates of HP 2-HG generation in vivo further demonstrate that, in a context-dependent manner, glutamine can be a primary carbon source for 2-HG production in mutant IDH tumors. Salamanca-Cardona et al. show that glutamine is a primary carbon source for the biosynthesis of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate in mutant IDH tumors. They develop a novel hyperpolarized MRI method using glutamine as a probe to detect 2-hydroxyglutarate formation in vivo in real time, non-invasively, and with high specificity.},

abstract = {The assessment of Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) fibre-tracking algorithms has been limited by the lack of an appropriate 'gold standard'. Practical limitations of alternative methods and physical models have meant that numerical simulations have become the method of choice in practice. However, previous numerical phantoms have consisted of separate fibres embedded in homogeneous backgrounds, which do not capture the true nature of white matter. In this paper we describe a method that is able to randomly generate numerical structures consisting of densely packed bundles of fibres, which are much more representative of human white matter, and simulate the DW-MR images that would arise from them under many imaging conditions. User-defined parameters may be adjusted to produce structures with a range of complexities that spans the levels we would expect to find in vivo. These structures are shown to contain many different features that occur in human white matter and which could confound fibre-tracking algorithms, such as tract kissing and crossing. Furthermore, combinations of such features can be sampled by the random generation of many different structures with consistent levels of complexity. The proposed software provides means for quantitative assessment via direct comparison between tracking results and the exact location of the generated fibres. This should greatly improve our understanding of algorithm performance and therefore prove an important tool for fibre tracking development. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Malignant CNS tumors in adults account for 1.7{\%} of new cancers and 2.1{\%} of cancer deaths. In Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and North America there are 7.5–14 new cases per 100000 population per year in males, and 4–11 new cases in females. Incidence rates of benign and borderline CNS tumors are available from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for the time period 1975–2004: incidence was 8.1 new cases per 100000 population per year in males, and 12.1 in females. Incidence and mortality significantly increased in white males and females from 1975–1991; subsequently, the incidence remained steady, and mortality decreased significantly from 1992–2004. In population-based studies less than 5{\%} of glioma risk is hereditary. Well-identified genetic syndromes that include primary brain tumors (PBTs) are most often autosomal dominant, and have variable penetrance. The most common syndrome is neurofibromatosis type 1. Ionizing radiation has a proven etiological role in experimental studies in monkeys and primates and, as a late complication of therapeutic X-irradiation, in humans. Extensive epidemiological research conducted during the past 20 years on occupational electromagnetic field exposure did not indicate strong or consistent associations with adult PBTs. The WHO/IARC has classified RF electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) based on an increased risk for glioma associated with wireless phone use.

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is known to have a limited capability of resolving multiple fiber orientations within one voxel. This is mainly because the probability density function (PDF) for random spin displacement is non-Gaussian in the confining environment of biological tissues and, thus, the modeling of self-diffusion by a second-order tensor breaks down. The statistical property of a non-Gaussian diffusion process is characterized via the higher-order tensor (HOT) coefficients by reconstructing the PDF of the random spin displacement. Those HOT coefficients can be determined by combining a series of complex diffusion-weighted measurements. The signal equation for an MR diffusion experiment was investigated theoretically by generalizing Fick's law to a higher-order partial differential equation (PDE) obtained via Kramers-Moyal expansion. A relationship has been derived between the HOT coefficients of the PDE and the higher-order cumulants of the random spin displacement. Monte-Carlo simulations of diffusion in a restricted environment with different geometrical shapes were performed, and the strengths and weaknesses of both HOT and established diffusion analysis techniques were investigated. The generalized diffusion tensor formalism is capable of accurately resolving the underlying spin displacement for complex geometrical structures, of which neither conventional DTI nor diffusion-weighted imaging at high angular resolution (HARD) is capable. The HOT method helps illuminate some of the restrictions that are characteristic of these other methods. Furthermore, a direct relationship between HOT and q-space is also established.},

We examine previous approaches to the problem and then propose a scheme based on the coherency of an auxiliary data structure imposed on the original object domain. After investigating both simple spatial enumeration and a hybrid octree approach, we developed 3DDDA, a 3D line generator for efficient traversing of both structures. 3DDDA provides an order of magnitude improvement in processing speed compared to other known ray-tracing methods. Processing time is found to be virtually independent of the number of objects involved in the scene. For large numbers of objects, this method actully becomes faster than scan-line methods. To remove jags from edges, a scheme for identifying edge orientation and distance from pixel center to true edge has been implemented. The time required for antialiasing depends on the total length of the edges encountered, but it is normally only a fractional addition to the time needed to produce the scene without antialiasing.},

Numerical simulations hold the promise of computing the diffusion weighted MR signal for more complex realistic tissue architectures and physiological models. This paper investigates a white matter model consisting of a matrix of coated cylinders with distinct diffusion coefficients and spin concentrations for each of the cylinder core, the coating, and the surrounding bath and compares results with an the analytical solution developed by Sen and Basser for the long diffusion time limit. Numerical simulations of diffusion weighted imaging experiments are performed for the three-medium model using a Monte Carlo diffusion simulation. Experiments are carried out for model parameters representing normal white matter. Pulse sequence parameters range from a low b value, long time limit, short pulse approximation to realistic clinical values. For simulations in the short pulse width, long diffusion time limit, numerical simulations agree with the Sen-Basser analytical result. When tested with realistic pulse sequence parameters, numerical simulations show lower anisotropy than the analytical model predicts. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 genes (IDH1 and IDH2) are commonly found in primary brain cancers. We previously reported that a novel enzymatic activity of these mutations results in the production of the putative oncometabolite, R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Here we investigated the ability of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect 2-HG production in order to non-invasively identify patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. Patients with intrinsic glial brain tumors (n = 27) underwent structural and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging prior to surgery. 2-HG levels from MRS data were quantified using LC-Model software, based upon a simulated spectrum obtained from a GAMMA library added to the existing prior knowledge database. The resected tumors were then analyzed for IDH1 mutational status by genomic DNA sequencing, Ki-67 proliferation index by immunohistochemistry, and concentrations of 2-HG and other metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). MRS detected elevated 2-HG levels in gliomas with IDH1 mutations compared to those with wild-type IDH1 (P = 0.003). The 2-HG levels measured in vivo with MRS were significantly correlated with those measured ex vivo from the corresponding tumor samples using LC-MS (r (2) = 0.56; P = 0.0001). Compared with wild-type tumors, those with IDH1 mutations had elevated choline (P = 0.01) and decreased glutathione (P = 0.03) on MRS. Among the IDH1 mutated gliomas, quantitative 2-HG values were correlated with the Ki-67 proliferation index of the tumors (r ( 2 ) = 0.59; P = 0.026). In conclusion, water-suppressed proton ((1)H) MRS provides a non-invasive measure of 2-HG in gliomas, and may serve as a potential biomarker for patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. In addition to 2-HG, alterations in several other metabolites measured by MRS correlate with IDH1 mutation status.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The corpus callosum is an important predilection site for traumatic axonal injury but may be unevenly affected in head trauma. We hypothesized that there were local differences in axonal injury within the corpus callosum as investigated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), varying among patients with differing severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Ten control subjects (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 37 -▌ 9 years) and 39 patients with TBI (27 men, 12 women; 34 -▌ 12 years) were investigated, of whom 24 had mild; 9, moderate; and 6, severe TBI. Regions of interest were selected in the callosal genu, body, and splenium to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the number of fibers passing through. Statistical comparison was made through analysis of variance with the Scheff+¬ post hoc analysis.RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with mild TBI investigated {\textless}3 months posttrauma (n = 12) had reduced FA (P {\textless} .01) and increased ADC (P {\textless} .05) in the genu, whereas patients with mild TBI investigated $\Gamma${\"{e}}{\~{N}}3 months posttrauma (n = 12) showed no significant differences. Patients with moderate and severe TBI, all investigated {\textless}3 months posttrauma, had reduced FA (P {\textless} .001) and increased ADC (P {\textless} .01) in the genu compared with controls and reduced FA in the splenium (P {\textless} .001) without significant ADC change.CONCLUSION: Mild TBI is associated with DTI abnormalities in the genu {\textless}3 months posttrauma. In more severe TBI, both the genu and splenium are affected. DTI suggests a larger contribution of vasogenic edema in the genu than in the splenium in TBI},

abstract = {The goal of the current investigation was to detect clinically important axonal damage in cerebral white matter after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, we evaluated a prospective, pilot study of six subjects with isolated mild TBI and six matched orthopedic controls. All subjects underwent DTI scanning, post-concussive symptom (PCS) assessment, and neurobehavioral testing within 72 h of injury. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and trace values in white matter voxels of whole brain and five preselected regions of interest (ROI) were compared in mild TBI and control subjects using a quantile approach. In addition, whole brain images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. All subjects underwent quality of life and repeat PCS assessment at 1 month. Whole brain images revealed significantly lower 1(st) percentile trace values (mean 0.465 vs. 0.488, p = 0.049) among mild TBI subjects. These trace values correlated with PCS scores at both 72 h (r = -0.57, p = 0.05) and 1 month (r = -0.61, p = 0.04). Analysis of ROIs showed mild TBI subjects to have significantly lower mean trace in the left anterior internal capsule (0.536 vs. 0.574, p = 0.007) and higher maximum ROI-specific median FA values (mean 0.801 vs. 0.756, p = 0.035) in the posterior corpus callosum. These FA values correlated with 72-h PCS score (r = -0.63, p = 0.03), and two neurobehavioral tests (visual motor speed [r = 0.63, p = 0.03] and impulse control [r = 0.59, p = 0.04]). Collectively, DTI detected significantly lower trace and elevated FA values in mild TBI subjects compared to controls. These abnormalities correlated to poor clinical outcome. We believe these findings represent axonal swelling, an early step in the process of axonal injury.},

@article{Stejskal1965,
abstract = {A derivation is given of the effect of a time‐dependent magnetic field gradient on the spin‐echo experiment, particularly in the presence of spin diffusion. There are several reasons for preferring certain kinds of time‐dependent magnetic field gradients to the more usual steady gradient. If the gradient is reduced during the rf pulses, H1 need not be particularly large; if the gradient is small at the time of the echo, the echo will be broad and its amplitude easy to measure. Both of these relaxations of restrictions on the measurement of diffusion coefficients by the spin‐echo technique serve to extend its range of applicability. Furthermore, a pulsed gradient can be recommended when it is critical to define the precise time period over which diffusion is being measured.The theoretical expression derived has been verified experimentally for several choices of time dependent magnetic field gradient. An apparatus is described suitable for the production of pulsed gradients with amplitudes as large as 100 G cm−1. The diffusion coefficient of dry glycerol at 26°±1°C has been found to be (2.5±0.2)×10−8 cm2 sec−1, a value smaller than can ordinarily be measured by the steady gradient method.},

These methods have been applied to a well characterized rat spinal cord injury model, affording a prediction of the increase in axonal permeability which is presumed to be closely related to functional deficit. ADC values are compared to those calculated from analytical formulas in the literature, and possible factors underlying the ADC behavior are explored. Calculated results indicate both axonal swelling and cell membrane permeability to be important factors contributing to ADC in traumatic spinal cord injury.},

@article{Duh2001,
abstract = {This article concerns the question of a proper stochastic treatment of the spin-echo self-diffusion attenuation of confined particles that arises when short gradient pulse approximation fails. Diffusion is numerically simulated as a succession of random steps when motion is restricted between two perfectly reflecting parallel planes. With the magnetic field gradient perpendicular to the plane boundaries, the spatial distribution of the spin-echo signal is calculated from the simulated trajectories. The diffusion propagator approach (Callaghan, "Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy," Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 1991), which is just the same as the evaluation of the spin-echo attenuation by the method of cumulant expansion in the Gaussian approximation, with Einstein's approximation of the velocity correlation function (VCF) (delta function), agrees with the results of simulation only for the particle displacements that are much smaller than the size of the confinement. A strong deviation from the results of the simulation appears when the bouncing rate from the boundaries increases at intermediate and long gradient sequences. A better fit, at least for intermediate particle displacements, was obtained by replacing the VCF with the Oppenheim-Mazur solution of the Langevin equation (Oppenheim and Mazur, Physica 30, 1833-1845, 1964), which is modified in a way to allow for spatial dependence of particle displacements. Clearly, interplay of the correlation dynamics and the boundary conditions is taking place for large diffusion displacements. However, the deviation at long times demonstrates a deficiency of the Gaussian approximation for the spin echo of diffusion inside entirely closed pores. Here, the cumulants higher than the second one might not be negligible. The results are compared with the experiments on the edge enhancement by magnetic resonance imaging of a pore. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {An off-lattice random-flight simulation procedure is described which accurately predicts the obstruction factors for self-diffusion of small molecules in macrofluids. The simulation procedure, employing a continuous step length distribution that ensures rapid and accurate convergence, was validated by comparison with exact results for cylindrical and spherical obstructions on 2D and 3D lattices. The exact results were computed with Rayleigh's multipole method, which also was used to derive a new analytical formula for the obstruction factor of parallel cylinders on a hexagonal lattice, of much higher accuracy than the commonly used approximations. Random-flight simulations were used to assess the accuracy of existing mean-field approximations for the obstruction factors of orientationally ordered nonspherical objects. Due to a near-cancellation of errors, the mean-field result accurately describes the obstruction effect on the trace of the diffusion tensor, as measured in isotropic systems, up to moderately high volume fractions. In contrast, the diffusion anisotropy, a sensitive indicator of microstructure in anisotropic fluids, is accurately predicted by mean-field theory only at low volume fractions.},

abstract = {While myelinated axons present an important barrier to water diffusion, many models used to interpret DWI signal neglect other potential influences of myelin. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were used to test the sensitivity of DWI results to the diffusive properties of water within myelin. Within these simulations, the apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app) varied slowly over several orders of magnitude of the coefficient of myelin water diffusion (D-m), but exhibited important differences compared to D-app values simulated that neglect D-m (= 0). Compared to D-app, the apparent diffusion kurtosis (K-app) was generally more sensitive to D-m. Simulations also tested the sensitivity of D-app and K-app to the amount of myelin present. Unique variations in D-app and K-app caused by differences in the myelin volume fraction were diminished when myelin water diffusion was included. Also, expected trends in Dapp and Kapp with experimental echo time were reduced or inverted when accounting for myelin water diffusion, and these reduced/inverted trends were seen experimentally in ex vivo rat brain DWI experiments. In general, myelin water has the potential to subtly influence DWI results and bias models of DWI that neglect these components of white matter.},

These algorithms simulate the interplay between three processes: (1) development of veins towards hormone (auxin) sources embedded in the leaf blade; (2) modification of the hormone source distribution by the proximity of veins; and (3) modification of both the vein pattern and source distribution by leaf growth. These processes are formulated in terms of iterative geometric operations on sets of points that represent vein nodes and auxin sources. In addition, a vein connection graph is maintained to determine vein widths. The effective implementation of the algorithms relies on the use of space subdivision (Voronoi diagrams) and time coherence between iteration steps. Depending on the specification details and parameters used, the algorithms can simulate many types of venation patterns, both open (tree−like) and closed (with loops). Applications of the presented algorithms include texture and detailed structure generation for image synthesis purposes, and modeling of morphogenetic processes in support of biological research.},

abstract = {Many closed-form analytical models have been proposed to relate the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) signal to microstructural features of white matter tissues. These models generally make assumptions about the tissue and the diffusion processes which often depart from the biophysical reality, limiting their reliability and interpretability in practice. Monte Carlo simulations of the random walk of water molecules are widely recognized to provide near groundtruth for DW-MRI signals. However, they have mostly been limited to the validation of simpler models rather than used for the estimation of microstructural properties. This work proposes a general framework which leverages Monte Carlo simulations for the estimation of physically interpretable microstructural parameters, both in single and in crossing fascicles of axons. Monte Carlo simulations of DW-MRI signals, or fingerprints, are pre-computed for a large collection of microstructural configurations. At every voxel, the microstructural parameters are estimated by optimizing a sparse combination of these fingerprints. Extensive synthetic experiments showed that our approach achieves accurate and robust estimates in the presence of noise and uncertainties over fixed or input parameters. In an in vivo rat model of spinal cord injury, our approach provided microstructural parameters that showed better correspondence with histology than five closed-form models of the diffusion signal: MMWMD, NODDI, DIAMOND, WMTI and MAPL. On whole-brain in vivo data from the human connectome project (HCP), our method exhibited spatial distributions of apparent axonal radius and axonal density indices in keeping with ex vivo studies. This work paves the way for microstructure fingerprinting with Monte Carlo simulations used directly at the modeling stage and not only as a validation tool.},

abstract = {Some microstructure parameters, such as permeability, remain elusive because mathematical models that express their relationship to the MR signal accurately are intractable. Here, we propose to use computational models learned from simulations to estimate these parameters. We demonstrate the approach in an example which estimates water residence time in brain white matter. The residence time $\tau$iof water inside axons is a potentially important biomarker for white matter pathologies of the human central nervous system, as myelin damage is hypothesised to affect axonal permeability, and thus $\tau$i. We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning (specifically here a random forest regressor) in order to learn a mapping between features derived from diffusion weighted MR signals and ground truth microstructure parameters, including $\tau$i. We test our numerical model using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that estimated parameters have strong correlations with the ground truth parameters (R2={\{}0.88,0.95,0.82,0.99{\}}) for volume fraction, residence time, axon radius and diffusivity respectively), and provide a marked improvement over the most widely used K{\"{a}}rger model (R2={\{}0.75,0.60,0.11,0.99{\}}). The trained model also estimates sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data acquired from healthy controls, matching values found in literature, and provides better reproducibility than the K{\"{a}}rger model on both the voxel and ROI level. Finally, we acquire data from two Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and compare to the values in healthy subjects. We find that in the splenium of corpus callosum (CC-S) the estimate of the residence time is 0.57±0.05 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CC-S it is 0.33±0.12 s in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and 0.19±0.11 s in the lesion. In the corticospinal tracts (CST) the estimate of the residence time is 0.52±0.09 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CST it is 0.56±0.05 s in the NAWM and 0.13±0.09 s in the lesion. These results agree with our expectations that the residence time in lesions would be lower than in NAWM because the loss of myelin should increase permeability. Overall, we find parameter estimates in the two MS patients consistent with expectations from the pathology of MS lesions demonstrating the clinical potential of this new technique.},

abstract = {Specific parameters of the neuronal tissue microstructure, such as axonal diameters, membrane permeability and intracellular water fractions are assessable using diffusion MRI. These parameters are commonly estimated using analytical models, which may introduce bias in the estimated parameters due to the approximations made when deriving the models. As an alternative to using analytical models, a database of signal curves generated by fast Monte Carlo simulations can be employed. Simulated diffusion MRI measurements were generated and evaluated using the two-compartment K??rger model as well as the simulation model based on a database containing signal curves from approximately 60 000 simulations performed with different combinations of microstructural parameters. A protocol based on a pulsed gradient spin echo sequence with diffusion times of 30 and 60 ms and with gradient amplitudes obtainable with a clinical MRI scanner was employed for the investigations. When using the analytical model, a major negative bias (up to approximately 25{\%}) in the estimated intracellular volume fraction was observed for short exchange times, while almost no bias was seen for the simulation model. In general, the simulation model improved the accuracy of the estimated parameters as compared to the analytical model, except for the exchange time parameter. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many axons follow wave-like undulating courses. This is a general feature of extracranial nerve segments, but is also found in some intracranial nervous tissue. The importance of axonal undulation has previously been considered, for example, in the context of biomechanics, where it has been shown that posture affects undulation properties. However, the importance of axonal undulation in the context of diffusion MR measurements has not been investigated. Using an analytical model and Monte Carlo simulations of water diffusion, this study compared undulating and straight axons in terms of diffusion propagators, diffusion-weighted signal intensities and parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging, such as the mean diffusivity (MD), the eigenvalues and the fractional anisotropy (FA). All parameters were strongly affected by the presence of undulation. The diffusivity perpendicular to the undulating axons increased with the undulation amplitude, thus resembling that of straight axons with larger diameters. Consequently, models assuming straight axons for the estimation of the axon diameter from diffusion MR measurements might overestimate the diameter if undulation is present. FA decreased from approximately 0.7 to 0.5 when axonal undulation was introduced into the simulation model structure. Our results indicate that axonal undulation may play a role in diffusion measurements when investigating, for example, the optic and sciatic nerves and the spinal cord. The simulations also demonstrate that the stretching or compression of neuronal tissue comprising undulating axons alters the observed water diffusivity, suggesting that posture may be of importance for the outcome of diffusion MRI measurements.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. Purpose: Water exchange exists between different neuronal compartments of brain tissue but is often ignored in most diffusion models. The goal of the current study was to demonstrate the dependence of diffusion measurements on echo time (TE) in the human brain and to investigate the underlying effects of myelin water exchange. Methods: Five healthy subjects were examined with single-shot pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar imaging with fixed duration ($\delta$) and separation ($\Delta$) of diffusion gradient pulses and a set of varying TEs. The effects of water exchange and intrinsic T 2 difference in cellular environments were investigated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Both in vivo measurements and simulations showed that fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) had positive correlations with TE, while radial diffusivity (RD) showed a negative correlation, which is consistent with a previous study. The simulation results further indicated the sensitivity of TE dependence to the change of g-ratio. Conclusion: The exchange between myelin and intra/extra-axonal water pools often plays a non-negligible role in the observed TE dependence of diffusion parameters, which may accompany or alter the effect of intrinsic T 2 in causing such dependence. The TE dependence may potentially serve as a biomarker for demyelination processes (e.g., in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease).},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of the current study was to investigate tissue pathology at the cellular level in traumatic brain injury (TBI) as revealed by Monte Carlo simulation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived parameters and elucidate the possible sources of conflicting findings of DTI abnormalities as reported in the TBI literature. METHODS: A model with three compartments separated by permeable membranes was employed to represent the diffusion environment of water molecules in brain white matter. The dynamic diffusion process was simulated with a Monte Carlo method using adjustable parameters of intra-axonal diffusivity, axon separation, glial cell volume fraction, and myelin sheath permeability. The effects of tissue pathology on DTI parameters were investigated by adjusting the parameters of the model corresponding to different stages of brain injury. RESULTS: The results suggest that the model is appropriate and the DTI-derived parameters simulate the predominant cellular pathology after TBI. Our results further indicate that when edema is not prevalent, axial and radial diffusivity have better sensitivity to axonal injury and demyelination than other DTI parameters. CONCLUSION: DTI is a promising biomarker to detect and stage tissue injury after TBI. The observed inconsistencies among previous studies are likely due to scanning at different stages of tissue injury after TBI.},

abstract = {Water diffusion in neurological tissues is known to possess multicomponent diffusion behavior. The fractions of fast and slow apparent diffusion components have often been attributed to the volume fractions of extracellular space (ECS) and intracellular space (ICS) although diffusion fractions are at variance with the tissue compartment volume ratios. In this article this puzzle was examined with a finite difference diffusion simulation model on the basis of optical images from sectioned rat spinal cord. Here the results show that assignment of fractions obtained from biexponential fits of fast and slow diffusion attenuation to ECS and ICS volume ratios is not correct. Rather, the observed multicomponent diffusion behavior is caused by motional restriction and limited intercompartmental water exchange in that at long diffusion times diffusion attenuation is shown to become monoexponential. Although the measured apparent diffusion fractions also depend on T2 relaxation time of water protons in the various compartments, the sensitivity to T2 is small and thus T2 differences are unlikely to explain the mismatch between apparent diffusion fractions and cellular volume fractions.},

The derivation of analytical mathematical models for analysing such experiments is only straightforward for ideal restricting geometries and rapidly becomes intractable as the geometrical complexity increases. Consequently, in general, numerical methods must be employed. Here, a highly flexible method for calculating the results of PGSE NMR experiments in porous systems in the short gradient pulse limit based on the finite element method is presented. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is verified by comparison with the known solutions to simple pore geometries (parallel planes, a cylindrical pore, and a spherical pore) and also to Monte Carlo simulations. The approach is then applied to modelling the more complicated cases of parallel semipermeable planes and a pore hopping model. Finally, the results of a PGSE measurement on a toroidal pore, a geometry for which there is presently no current analytical solution, are presented. This study shows that this approach has great potential for modelling the results of PGSE experiments on real (3D) porous systems.

Its use allows to study pore size distributions, tortuosity, and permeability as a function of the relaxation time, diffusivity, and flow.

However, solving this equation analytically becomes intractable for all but the simplest geometries. We present an efficient numerical framework for solving the complete BT equation in arbitrarily complex domains. In addition to the standard BT equation, the generalised BT formulation takes into account the flow and relaxation terms, allowing a better representation of the phenomena under scope. The presented framework is flexible enough to deal parametrically with any order of convergence in the spatial domain. The major advantage of such approach is to allow both faster computations and sensitivity analyses over realistic geometries. Moreover, we developed a second-order implicit scheme for the temporal discretisation with similar computational demands as the existing explicit methods. This represents a huge step forward for obtaining reliable results with few iterations. Comparisons with analytical solutions and real data show the flexibility and accuracy of the proposed methodology.},

In spatial domains that model biological tissues at the cellular level, these two types of PDEs have to be completed with permeability conditions on the cellular interfaces. To solve these PDEs, we implemented a finite elements method that allows jumps in the solution at the cell interfaces by using double nodes. Using a transformation of the Bloch-Torrey PDE we reduced oscillations in the searched-for solution and simplified the implementation of the boundary conditions. The spatial discretization was then coupled to the adaptive explicit Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev time-stepping method. Our proposed method is second order accurate in space and second order accurate in time. We implemented this method on the FEniCS C++ platform and show time and spatial convergence results. Finally, this method is applied to study some relevant questions in diffusion MRI. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The idea is that they can measure the ADC parallel and perpendicular to fibres to see whether there's damange to the fibres. 

Cylinders are simulated on square and hexagonal lattices. 

Simulations are very similar to Szafer et. al 1995 but has two differences - T2 is ignored and rather than reflecting a particle, it is just left where it is. This is to prevent the need to track multiple reflections. 

Use a finite length gradient pulse.

abstract = {A geometrical confinement considerably affects the diffusive motion of the nuclei and the consequent signal attenuation under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In this article, we illustrate the use of Laplacian eigenfunctions to describe this effect. Starting from the classical Bloch-Torrey equation, we obtain the free induction decay (FID) and the spin-echo or gradient-echo signal in a compact matrix form. Each attenua- tion mechanism (restricted diffusion, gradient dephasing, surface or bulk relaxation) is represented by a matrix which is constructed from the Laplace operator eigenbasis and thus depending only on the geometry of the confinement. In turn, the physical parame- ters (free diffusion coefficient, gradient intensity, surface or bulk relaxivity) characterize the ‘‘strengths'' of the underlying attenuation mechanisms and naturally appear as coeffi- cients in front of these matrices. Once the Laplacian eigenfunctions for a given confine- ment are found (analytically or numerically), further computation of the macroscopic sig- nal is more accurate and much faster than by using conventional simulation methods. The matrix technique is actually a simple numerical tool to deal with arbitrary gradient waveforms, including simple or stimulated, single or multiple spin echoes. We illustrate its efficiency by considering restricted diffusion in simple domains: a slab, a cylinder, and a sphere. In a companion paper, we shall focus on theoretical advances achieved by using Laplacian eigenfunctions},

Their implementation has this rejection sampling approach which basically means that new geometries are implemented by changing the rejection regions, but I think this will be difficult to generalise to complex geometries and for including things like permeability.},

Expressions are obtained for the echo attenuation under the narrow-gradient-pulse condition for rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical pores. The cylindrical result is new, while those for rectangular and spherical pores differ from previously published formulas. The present results are verified in a number of special limits. It is shown that "diffraction" effects are still strongly apparent when wall relaxation is taken into account. Furthermore, deviations in the pore radius, a, obtained from the position of the echo minimum, are weak in practice, provided that the time between the gradient pulses exceeds a2/D, where D is the molecular self-diffusion coefficient. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press.

Purpose: To assess the validity of the superposition approximation for crossing fascicles, i.e., the assumption that the total diffusion-weighted MRI signal is the sum of the signals arising from each fascicle independently, even when the fascicles intermingle in a voxel. Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the impact of the approximation on the diffusion-weighted MRI signal and to assess whether this approximate model allows microstructural features of interwoven fascicles to be accurately estimated, despite signal differences. Results: Small normalized signal differences were observed, typically 10-3-10-2. The use of the approximation had little impact on the estimation of the crossing angle, the axonal density index, and the radius index in clinically realistic scenarios wherein the acquisition noise was the predominant source of errors. In the absence of noise, large systematic errors due to the superposition approximation only persisted for the radius index, mainly driven by a low sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI signals to small radii in general. Conclusion: The use of the superposition approximation rather than a model of interwoven fascicles does not adversely impact the estimation of microstructural features of interwoven fascicles in most current clinical settings.},

The distribution is assumed to be Gaussian in the intermediate case, and the problem is reduced to the calculation of the mean square phase change due to diffusion.

White matter is composed of irregularly packed axons leading to a structural disorder in the extra-axonal space. Diffusion MRI experiments using oscillating gradient spin echo sequences have shown that the diffusivity transverse to axons in this extra-axonal space is dependent on the frequency of the employed sequence. In this study, we observe the same frequency-dependence using 3D simulations of the diffusion process in disordered media. We design a novel white matter numerical phantom generation algorithm which constructs biomimicking geometric configurations with few design parameters, and enables to control the level of disorder of the generated phantoms. The influence of various geometrical parameters present in white matter, such as global angular dispersion, tortuosity, presence of Ranvier nodes, beading, on the extra-cellular perpendicular diffusivity frequency dependence was investigated by simulating the diffusion process in numerical phantoms of increasing complexity and fitting the resulting simulated diffusion MR signal attenuation with an adequate analytical model designed for trapezoidal OGSE sequences.This work suggests that angular dispersion and especially beading have non-negligible effects on this extracellular diffusion metrics that may be measured using standard OGSE DW-MRI clinical protocols.},

abstract = {The pulsed field gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance method is used to measure the translational diffusion of solvents and solutes in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. It is widely used in the characterization of molecules and materials in general, via phenomena such as ‘diffusion interference'. It is also the basis of tissue discrimination in magnetic resonance imaging, via diffusion tensor imaging. The mathematical equation used to analyze data from a simple noninteracting solute (using a pair of magnetic field gradient pulses that are applied in the experiment) was first derived by Stejskal and Tanner. However, in the article and in subsequent presentations the basic derivation, which we call the the ‘‘theoretical physics'' of the theory, is not pre- sented in extenso. Conversely, many papers in which the exploration of the effects of mag- netic field gradient pulses of shapes other than simple rectangles generally begin with the time-dependent integral that emerges from the original theoretical physics. To fill this ‘‘pedagogical gap'' we use here a rigorous step-by-step approach to the theoretical physics of the Stejskal–Tanner equation and indicate how it was based on earlier theories. We also take the opportunity to indicate a contemporary approach to deriving new relationships between user-defined magnetic field gradient pulse shapes and the diffusion coefficient; and we show how these can be rapidly and accurately derived using symbolic computation.},

Similar systems in the literature consider only simple substrates and their authors do not consider convergence and parameter optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo simulations within complex irregular substrates. We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess precision and accuracy of the generated results. We obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

We focus here on the practicalities of both implementing such techniques and using them in applications. Specifically, the article summarizes the relevant aspects of brain microanatomy and the range of diffusion-weighted MR measurements that provide sensitivity to them. It then reviews the evolution of mathematical and computational models that relate the diffusion MR signal to brain tissue microstructure, as well as the expanding areas of application. Next we focus on practicalities of designing a working microstructure imaging technique: model selection, experiment design, parameter estimation, validation, and the pipeline of development of this class of technique.
