# Thesis Template
This is my LaTeX thesis template which is a modified version of https://github.com/npcardoso/PhDThesis

To use with OverLeaf, you need to make sure that main.tex is set to be the main file and set the TexLive version to 2016. Additionally, if using with an offline editor, I have tested this with TexLive 2017 which works. Newer versions may be incompatible.
